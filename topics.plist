				<string>What is Abuse?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The LORD examines the righteous, 
       but the wicked and those who love violence 
       his soul hates&quot;. Psalm 11:5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God hates violence against His children. It is not ok for anyone to physically or emotionally harm another person. 

Abuse takes on many forms and it can be from a parent, family member, another adult in the community OR it can also be from a boyfriend or girlfriend. 

Physical abuse is when someone intentionally harms someone else physically. Examples include slapping, punching, shoving, kicking, burning, and biting. It can also include being confined for long periods of time (locked in a closet, tied up, etc.)
Emotional abuse is using words and actions to make someone else feel bad, afraid, or controlled. Examples include being told they are &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;worthless&quot;, being threatened, and being isolated from other friends and family. This can be done in person or via texting and other technologies. 
Sexual abuse can include physical contact, such as inappropriate touching or rape, but other examples are making someone watch videos of others having sex or being forced to look at private body parts of another person. 
Neglect is when an adult fails to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision such that their child&apos;s health, safety, and well-being are threatened with harm.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>If you are being abused it is not your fault and you are not alone. Pray that God would give you the courage, wisdom, and direction to seek help from a trusted adult.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How do I know if I am in an abusive marriage or dating relationship?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.&quot; Ephesians 5:25</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Even though this verse is directed towards &quot;husbands&quot;, it is an excellent example of how God wants us to treat each other in our relationships. Some people have actually tried to use the Bible to defend abusive behaviors against their spouse but abuse and control are not part of God&apos;s plan. How did Christ love the church? By serving others, washing their feet, loving and forgiving people, and ultimately dying for us all.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>You might be in an abusive relationship if you experience any of the following: name calling, being made fun of, controlling behaviors, intimidation, isolation from friends and family, being physically hurt, or pressured or forced to have sex. Using the internet or texting to bully or hurt you and/or stalking you are other forms of abuse.  

Put God first in your marriage and date life, begin praying for your relationships. Give God control and obey Him as He leads you.  Seek help from a trusted believer in Christ. Seek counsel for your marriage if you suspect abuse. If you are dating an abusive person get out of the relationship.

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Where is God?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; 
       he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.&quot;        Psalm 22:24-25
&quot;I waited patiently for the LORD; 
       he turned to me and heard my cry. 
  He lifted me out of the slimy pit, 
       out of the mud and mire; 
       he set my feet on a rock 
       and gave me a firm place to stand. 
  He put a new song in my mouth, 
       a hymn of praise to our God. 
       Many will see and fear 
       and put their trust in the LORD.&quot; Psalm 40:1-3</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God is turning to you and hears your cry. He has not hidden His face. The Scriptures have given you a promise. Claim the promise and stand firm on the ROCK, the Lord.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>When someone is being abused they often feel very much alone. It is important to know that God is always with you and He loves you. When you cry out to God, he hears you. He wants to be your stability and strength during this difficult time. Take comfort in his love and power and pray that he will protect you and help you.

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What can I do if I am being abused?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; 
       give ear to me and hear my prayer. 
  Show the wonder of your great love, 
       you who save by your right hand 
       those who take refuge in you from their foes. 
 Keep me as the apple of your eye; 
       hide me in the shadow of your wings.&quot; Psalm 17:6-13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God wants us to call out to him in our time of trouble and pain. You are the &quot;apple of His eye&quot; and he wants to be your refuge and protector.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>It is tempting to keep information about abuse a secret. You might have been threatened to never tell anyone. You might be confused as you care for the person hurting you and do not want to see them get in trouble. However, abuse in any form is WRONG and it is important that you seek help.

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How do I help friends that I think are being abused?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot; John 8:44</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Satan is the father of lies. He uses lies to prevent people from seeking help. Your friend might believe that the abuse is her or his fault. He or she might also believe that the person causing the abuse will change or that if they &quot;behave&quot; or act better they will not be abused anymore. Your friend might also be afraid to tell anyone about what has happened.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>It is important that you help friends understand that it is NOT their fault, they can not do anything to change the behavior of the abuser, and they need to seek help from a trusted adult like a teacher, pastor, or school counselor. Also, be sure you speak the truth IN LOVE (Ephesians 4:15). You can hurt someone you are trying to help if you make them feel like they are stupid or at fault for &quot;getting into&quot; this situation. Pray for your friends by asking God to protect them, to rescue them, and to be their source of strength and peace during this difficult time. Seek help from another mature believer in Christ.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How is a person supposed to know which religion truly leads to God?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;----and the Scripture cannot be broken--&quot;  John 10:35

&quot;Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.&quot; 1 John 4:1

&quot;We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.&quot; 1 John 4:6</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>We are to test the spirits realizing that if a particular religion does not align with the scriptures, it is not the truth.  
Three key elements to consider when choosing a denomination: 
1.Attitude Toward the Bible
2.Attitude Toward Christ 
3.Attitude Toward Salvation</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Every religion under the sun, whether pseudo-Christian or non-Christian that teaches man can do something to earn, or help to earn his own salvation is FALSE. Only true Biblical Christianity recognizes man as he really is, utterly lost in sin, destined for eternal separation from God. The gospel, &quot;by which you are saved&quot; is the glorious news that &quot;Christ died for our sin&quot; (I Corinthians 15:1,3), and that we can be saved by grace, through personal faith in Christ, plus nothing else whatever! Any religion which teaches otherwise is, to that extent, wrong.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What do Christians believe?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God&apos;s one and only Son.&quot; John 3:17-18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Christians believe that God sent his only son to die and pay for their sins and who ever believes in Him will not die, but will have eternal life as it states in John 3:16. The only way to escape death is know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life recognizing you are a sinner in need of saving. See the &quot;Saved&quot; topic on this app for more information.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The Apostle`s Creed is a summation of the Christian beliefs spoken in many churches today which is founded on these main principles of Christianity:
Belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Holy Spirit
The death, descent into hell, resurrection, and ascension of Christ
The holiness of the Church and the communion of saints
Christ&apos;s second coming, the Day of Judgment and salvation of the faithful</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does Jesus tell us about religion?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: &quot;The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses&apos; seat. So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men&apos;s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them &apos;Rabbi.&apos; But you are not to be called &apos;Rabbi,&apos; for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth &apos;father,&apos; for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called &apos;teacher,&apos; for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.&quot; Matthew 23:1-12</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus walked the earth some 2000 years ago.  His life and ministry was very real, and was in accordance with God&apos;s perfect plan and will as foretold through the Prophets and Moses in the books of the Old Testament.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Jesus came and served so that all who come to Him as humble servants might have the abundant life leading to life eternal.  Jesus teaches us religion in its most simple and perfect way.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the most important rule or teaching in the Christian religion?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, &quot;If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot; John 8:31-32

On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.&quot; John 7:37-38</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Christianity teaches freedom in Christ and truth through Jesus alone. If you are thirsty Jesus fills the thirst. The greatest of all commandments is to love God and love one another. (Matthew 22:36)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Being a Christian is not about rules or restrictions.  People in the world will tell you that Christianity is only about doing things to try and please God and following strict rules.  Well Jesus tells us differently.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How should we worship as Christians?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot;  John 4:23-24</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus was speaking to the Samaritan woman who was inquiring about the proper place to worship –on the mountain or in the city of Jerusalem, but Jesus answered a time is coming when worship is in the heart of those that know me and my Father. She went on to respond, &quot;I know the Messiah is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us&quot;.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>This Bible story is classic.  Here is Jesus in the flesh sharing the truth.  The Messiah is right before her eyes and she cannot recognize Him. As Christians we no longer have to go before the altars in the city or the mountain before God.  He is in our hearts and by the power of the Holy Spirit we can worship wherever and whenever we want. The Spirit is in us and God is a Spirit. We should be reverent and in awe for he is a consuming fire. (Hebrews 11:28-29)</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I be healed?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, if I just touch his clothes, I will be healed. Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.&quot; Mark 5:27-29</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This is the account of a woman who had a blood disease for twelve years. She had faith knowing that just one touch from Jesus would heal her. The verse continues as Jesus feels power go from Him instantly. He asks &quot;who touched my clothes&quot; and said to her &quot;daughter your faith has healed you&quot;.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Have faith to believe that Jesus can heal you and if it is His will you will be healed. Go to Him in prayer believing that healing is available to you through Christ.  Read the Bible accounts of the healings performed by Jesus and later by the disciples and the Apostle Paul as they walked in the authority given to them in Jesus.  Pray without ceasing and never give up believing for healing. This woman never gave up believing for healing even after twelve years of sickness.</string>

				<string>Is my sickness punishment from God?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.&quot; Romans 8:1-2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>For believers in Jesus, all our sin – past, present and future – has already been punished on the cross.  As Christians, we will never be punished for sin. That was done once for all.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Because of the sacrifice of Christ, God sees only the righteousness of Christ when He looks at us. Our sin has been nailed to the cross with Jesus, and we will never be punished for it.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why won&apos;t God heal me?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.&quot; Proverbs 3:5-6

&quot;And we know in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot; Romans 8:28</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Struggling with illness is a huge burden.  When you feel like God has ignored your prayers, abandoned you and allowed your pain to continue (which are very normal responses) you are leaning to your own understanding. It is an issue of faith.  Do you love God and have you received the call to go according to His purpose and not your own? If you have, the Bible says He will work it out for good and He will make your paths straight. Some of the best things in life come out of our response to periods of pain, both physical and emotional. Look to the book of Job and read his faithful response to suffering. In the end, God gave Job three times more than what he had before the suffering.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>(See question #2 on this topic) God did not cause your suffering and you are not being punished.  Could God heal you? Sure, He is God, and the Bible says healing is possible through Christ (by his stripes we are healed). But it also says it is His will and not our own that matters. He knows everything and that includes His plans for you. We must trust Him to do what is best and to know what is best. When we consider the Bible&apos;s teaching on prayer, we learn that God may exercise His power in response to our prayer, or He may surprise us with a different course of action. In His wisdom He always does what is best.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I comfort someone when they are suffering?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.&quot; Matthew 18:4
 
&quot;Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.&quot; 1 John 3:18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>A child cannot care for themselves so they are vulnerable. Jesus uses this analogy for us to help those unable to help themselves – children, the sick, the poor, the widows – and you should comfort with love by actually doing something allowing your actions to speak louder than your words.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>It is easy to say I will pray for you and easy to tell someone you are available to help if they need you, but too often our words are meaningless because we forget to pray and our open offer to help is just that, an offer, but not a deed.  When people are suffering they are usually embarrassed and feel uncomfortable giving up control to seek help. Let them see Christ in you. Show up at the hospital and keep them company. Take a meal over to their home. Really remember to pray. Your actions will speak louder than words and Christ will be seen in your deeds.</string>

				<string>Can anything good come from my sickness?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.&quot; James 1:2-4</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Have pure joy in sickness? It is a tough word to receive, but your patience in the sickness will yield a mature and complete new you in Christ. We know according to Romans 8 &quot;that all things work for good to those who love God and are called according to his purpose&quot;. Your testing will give you fruit! (See Galatians 5; Fruits of the Spirit; Long Suffering is a fruit)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Did you know for gold to be pure and radiant it has to go through the fire? If you are in the fire, you are one step closer to a new, beautiful, precious you! Patience is difficult, but it is necessary. Remember what your mom said, &quot;all good things come to those who wait&quot;. Be still and know the Lord has a glorious plan for His child.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is sin?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&quot; 1 John 1:8-9

&quot;Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.&quot; 1 John 3:4</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Sin is lawlessness and wrong doing that separates us from God.  Do not be deceived everyone has sin; the only perfect man was Jesus. If we confess our sins he is faithful to forgive us. See Keep It Real for our guide to sin as God defined it in the Bible.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Did God create us to sin?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Father forgive them for they know not what they do.&quot; Matthew 23:34</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus said this from the cross as He paid for our sins by dying for us. This verse shows His love for us and supports the claim that we were not created to sin, but have been deceived by Satan; blinded from the truth, not knowing what we are doing is sinful. However, born again believers in Christ, know the truth!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Man has to a large extent with Satan&apos;s influence turned the mind into a tool for self-deception. It happened first in the Garden of Eden (see Creation on this app) when the serpent tempted Adam and Eve. God created us in his own image, an image free from sin; yet, mankind began to hear only Satan&apos;s side of the story believing the lie of the enemy. The only way to die to sin is to give your life to the Lord. Pray daily asking Him to keep you from temptation and asking with a sincere heart for Him to forgive your sins.  The Apostle Paul said &quot;we must die daily&quot; meaning to deny the nature of the sinful flesh and be born each new day with Christ.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How did sin come into the world?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned----for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.&quot; Romans 5:12-13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Sin entered the world through one man, meaning Adam, before God gave the law or commandments to Moses. And death through Adam is life through Christ.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Read Genesis Chapter 3 to discover the entry of sin into this world as the serpent, Satan, tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Things were blissful and one bite of a forbidden apple from the forbidden tree of knowledge took all mankind to a destination of death and hell. We have a super hero Jesus who supernaturally swooped in, saved our souls, and destined our lives toward a promise of eternity. Do you know Him? Would you like to? He is your only hope from sin.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Will my sins keep me from Heaven?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in heavenly realms in Christ Jesus…&quot; Ephesians 2:3-6</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>If you are alive in Christ, meaning Jesus is your savior, your sin or transgressions cannot keep you from Heaven. When you are born again in Christ your conviction to keep from sin becomes stronger and you desire to lead a less sinful life, but not a sinless life, for no one is without sin but Jesus. It is by His grace you are saved and if you know Him you will one day be in Heaven with Him. But if you do not know Christ, then yes, your sin can keep you from Heaven.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Jesus said that no one can snatch a Christian from His hands, regardless if they committed even the most grievous sin, such as murder. Legalists who misinterpret the Bible and scare Christians with their false manipulative teachings think that sin can cause a Christian to lose his or her salvation. This is absolutely not true. There is nothing we can do to earn salvation and there is nothing we can do to keep it. Salvation is a total gift from God that we cannot earn and that we do not deserve. If we truly believe from our hearts that we are all sinners and we cannot save ourselves, that Jesus Christ paid the full penalty for our sins and obtained eternal life for us through His death on the cross and resurrection, then we are saved.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Is one sin greater than another sin?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin. &quot;He said this because they were saying.&quot; He has an evil spirit.&quot; Mark 3:28-30</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>These words were spoken by Jesus and he said all sin is forgiven, except when it comes to the Holy Spirit. The Trinity represents the Father, Son and Holy Spirit which is the God head. Jesus, the embodiment of the Trinity, is the Holy Spirit. When Jesus said only one sin is unforgivable it was said in response to a crowd that claimed he must be possessed by demons from Satan to be able to cast out demons. When they said he had an evil spirit, they were denouncing Jesus Himself. Simply unforgivable!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Sin is sin! There is no difference between telling a lie, having a jealous heart, dishonoring your parents or stealing. Even the most evil criminals in prison can be forgiven if they truly repent of their sins. All sin is equal in the eyes of the Lord and all forgiven if YOU KNOW JESUS; however, if you DO NOT KNOW JESUS that is the greatest sin never to be forgiven.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does it mean to witness to others?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot; &quot;How then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent?&quot; As it is written, &quot;How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.&quot; &quot; Romans 10:14-15</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Witnessing to others is sharing the good news or the gospel of Jesus Christ. As Christians we are to be &quot;fisher of men&quot; (Matthew 4:19), to catch those lost. Those individuals witnessing or sharing their testimonies of what Jesus has done in their life will receive a special crown in Heaven known as The Crown of Rejoicing (1 Thess. 2:19).</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>When you think about how precious life is and how no one is promised tomorrow, the reality of death is palpable. As a Christian, you have confidence that your eternity is in Heaven, but others around you that do not know Christ are destined to an eternity in hell. Please cast your net deeper to catch all those lost before it is too late. If they haven&apos;t heard the gospel, maybe God placed you in their life to share the good news.  Use this app to share Biblical truth with the lost. Be fisher of men just like Jesus wants you to be!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How do I witness to others?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.&quot; Colossians 4:5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>When you witness it should be in kindness and graciousness with words that are not offensive, but loving. Do not become argumentative or accusatory. You are the mouth piece from God sent for that moment to share the gospel, so act accordingly. You should conduct yourself just like you would if Jesus was standing right next to you. (See Keep It Real for practical guidelines)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Make sure to pray before you witness. Keep it simple, share your salvation story or testimony, and memorize a verse when possible to share, ask questions, listen with patience and be a positive example/witness for Christ. If you see a change taking place and a genuine interest to know Christ better is developing, encourage them to attend church with you or pray with them. If you feel comfortable you can pray the sinner&apos;s prayer with them should they accept Christ in your conversation. 

Pray: Dear Lord, greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world. I am equipped by Christ and His authority to speak in truth, wisdom, love and spirit. Let my words be seasoned with salt. Let my words be directly from your mouth to mine. Give me courage to stand up on your behalf as you did on mine. Please allow this child of God to open their heart to know you as I do. In Jesus&apos; Name, AMEN</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Who should I start witnessing to?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>Then he said to Thomas, &quot;Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting Thomas and believe.&quot; John 20:27

Then Jesus told him, &quot;Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&quot; John 20:27</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Thomas was one of the disciples. He was in Jesus&apos; close circle; yet, he did not believe Jesus had visited the disciples after His death. Jesus had to prove to Thomas that He was alive. The point is this, even if you hang out with Godly people and think they truly believe, it is possible they really do not know Jesus as the resurrected King. The best place to start witnessing is in your circle of friends and family.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Start witnessing to your friends and acquaintances. People you feel comfortable around, but people you aren&apos;t sure if they know Christ personally. Hopefully they have seen Christ in you and it won&apos;t be shocking for them to talk with you about God. Work God into the conversation and feel out the waters. Try to find out if they are a believer or not. If not, use witnessing tools from church, websites or this application and begin to share your personal story of why you know God is real. If you don&apos;t have a specific story to share, talk about the existence of conscience, guilt, the search for purpose and religions in general. Let the Bible support your words.

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Will witnessing to others matter to God?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day – and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing,&quot; 2 Timothy 4:7-8</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Apostle Paul committed most of his life to witnessing. He traveled all over the countries along the Mediterranean Sea. He started the first churches founded in Christ and spread the word of God with passion and vigor. He compares his journey to a race and a fight to the finish. Paul knew the Lord would crown him in righteousness and others along the way because the Lord told him he would.  Yes, our witnessing matters to God!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Have you ever competed in a race for a school track team? Your performance can help the team place. To be prepared to run the race, it is important you wear the right running shoes, get positioned properly at the starting blocks to get off to a good start, stay in your lane and pace yourself along the way pushing to the goal.  Running for Jesus is a lot like a race too. He shrouds our feet fitted with the readiness of the gospel of peace to get us going, gives us position of great worth in Him, He keeps us on track with the Holy Spirit and in worship/prayer/faith we have endurance to claim the prize. Paul was right. We are in the race of our lives and when we win others to Christ the whole team wins too!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does the Bible say about witnessing?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Through him and for his name&apos;s sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.&quot; Romans 1:5-6</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This is just one of many verses that commission us as called people to spread the word of Christ. We are apostles (religious messengers or ambassadors) in Christ. We have a title as believers, making us crucial members in the Kingdom of God. You are a name sake of Christ.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>A witness gives firsthand account of something seen, heard or experienced. A witness serves as a sign or evidence. A witness has personal knowledge to share, can attest to the authenticity of something or someone. Finally, a witness affirms their religious faith. You are an apostle, ambassador and witness, all magnificent titles you possess as a Christian.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How do I know the Bible is true?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints, and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.&quot; Hebrews 4:12</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible is so unique that merely reading it brings power.  When we consider that the Scriptures were written over many years, by different people in various parts of the world, without any contradiction, we can only conclude that the Bible is the Truth of God.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The Bible is the written record of God&apos;s revelation to humankind. It is one book, and yet is a compilation of 66 books written over a period of almost 2000 years! The diversity of its contributors ranges from a king to a shepherd, from a doctor to a choirmaster, from a former tax collector to a former fisherman. Yet this diversity contributes to a central unity of purpose: the reconciliation of man to his Creator and God.

				<string>What do the Scriptures Say About Themselves?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.&quot; 2 Peter 1:21</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible was written by men, but it was the Spirit of God who guided them and made sure it was accurate and correct.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Why should we trust the Bible? Some skeptics say that there are many ways to live a good life and that we don&apos;t have to bother following the Bible. They say that as long as we do our best, God will accept us. If that is true, 
How do you define what&apos;s good and right? 
Who has the correct standards? 
How can something be right for one person and not for another? 
Who determines the consequences for doing wrong?

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does Jesus say about the people and events of the Bible?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.&quot; Matthew 5:17-18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Whenever Jesus quoted the Bible, He used it as an absolute authority, indicating its reliability and truth. The law was his reference to Scripture and the prophets were the people God used to write the law as he gave it to them through His Spirit.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Jesus spoke of many people that were faithful to write God&apos;s law and abide by it, such as Moses and David. Jesus even went to the temple in Nazareth and read from the scroll of Isaiah saying, &quot;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.&quot; (Luke 4:21)  Jesus was the walking mouthpiece of righteousness, the word of God in the flesh, promoting, fulfilling and living the Bible in action, deed and word.

				<string>How can I understand the Bible?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says…The man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this…he will be blessed in what he does.&quot; James 1:22-25</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>If you really want to know what the Bible has to say, you need to study it! God promises to honor our efforts. Bibles are written in different versions or &quot;translations&quot;. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament in Greek. Each translation has its own strengths and weaknesses. The King James Version (KJV) is excellent, but you must use a dictionary as you read because it uses language typical of the time it was translated (1611). The New American Standard Version (NASV) is believed by many to be one of the most accurate translations and is an excellent study Bible. The American Standard Version (ASV) is also excellent. The New King James Version (NKJV) is high on the recommended list. The New International Version (NIV) tries to make the text as easy to understand as possible and is an excellent reading Bible, but not a good study Bible. Although the exact choice of words or sentence structure is different in each translation, the meaning is identical. Take the words of Jesus in Mark 16:16 from three &quot;versions&quot; as an example; NIV: &quot;Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved&quot;. KJV: &quot;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved&quot;. NAS: &quot;He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved&quot; Different words and sentences but the meaning is identical. See “Keep It Real” for guidelines to help you get more from your study time.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>1.Ask God for help.  &quot;Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law&quot; Psalm 119:18. His Holy Spirit will help us as He teaches us the truth of His Word (John 14:26).
2.Look for the meaning of the words you are reading.  When you come across words you don&apos;t understand, use a dictionary to find their meanings.
3.Consider the context.  Don&apos;t just read one verse. Try to read a few verses before and after so you understand what that section is talking about.
4.You won&apos;t get it all on the first day. It takes time to understand the Bible. Reading God&apos;s Word is a privilege believers can enjoy for their entire lives! Don&apos;t put pressure on yourself to understand it all at once. You&apos;ll enjoy it more and more as you grow in your Christian life.
5.Keep things in perspective.  Make sure your understanding of a verse is in harmony with what other Bible verses say. Remember that the Bible doesn&apos;t contradict itself, so don&apos;t jump to a conclusion that misinterprets God&apos;s word. Ask another Christian you trust for their help when you need to.
6.Find a church where the Bible is taught.  Listen to the sermon in church.  Take notes.  Look up verses that are mentioned in the message.
7.Read with others.  Try reading the Bible with a group of other Christians.  It will provide you some accountability and a place to discuss what you are learning.
8.Ask for help.  Go to someone you know is a Christian and ask them for help in growing in your ability to read and understand the Bible.
9.Get started.  God is eager to connect with you through the scriptures and when you approach with an open heart and a desire to grow in your faith, He will meet you there.

				<string>What makes the Bible important?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.&quot; 2 Timothy 3:16</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible is literally from God, your creator, sent as a living example for how to live an abundant and purposeful life in Him. In Ephesians, Chapter 6 it states the word is the Sword of the Spirit. It is mighty.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The Bible has touched millions of lives impacting the world. Wherever the Bible has been consistently read and applied, it has changed the lives ‑ indeed the civilization and culture ‑ of those who accept it.  No other book has had such an impact on individuals and societies.  Anyone can read it and discover that impact for themselves. Some nations ban the Bible and some individuals die fighting to keep it and share its truth.  No other book has stirred such passion and power.

				<key>question</key>
				<string>I am a teenager now.  Will Christ return to earth in my lifetime?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.  I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.&quot; Luke 21:29-32</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus uses a fig tree and its growth to maturity, to describe the nation of Israel Since the nation of Israel was recognized as a state on May 14, 1948, the fig tree has been considered by many to have reached maturity.  Accordingly, this sign of the end time drawing near has been fulfilled and points to the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Because Jesus also said that, when the fig tree sprouts leaves (i.e. reaches maturity), the generation living at that time will not pass before his return means that his return will be soon!  The fruit is ripe!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>So Christians, get ready! Look up! Pray! Spread the Gospel with those who do not know it for redemption draws near. The King is truly coming soon! No one knows the hour for He will come like a thief in the night, but scripture has been fulfilled to support Jesus&apos; return at any time.</string>

				<string>What is the difference between the rapture and the second coming of Christ?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Listen I tell you a mystery; We will not sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true:  Death has been swallowed up in victory.&quot; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54

&quot;After that, we who are still alive and left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.&quot; 1Thessalonians 4:17 

&quot;I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and makes war.&quot; Revelation 19:11</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The first stage described above is called the rapture which refers to the Lord coming in the sky. He will not descend to earth at that time.  The rapture is a moment of time when the dead in Christ (i.e. those already in Heaven) will rise to unite their bodies with their souls which are in Heaven along with the living Christians who will be caught up in the air becoming immortal as they ascend to Heaven. In the second coming mentioned in Revelation 19:11 through verse 21, Christ comes on a white horse to judge the world in a mighty war and all will see Him along with &quot;the armies of heaven&quot;  coming in the skies to save and rule over the world after defeating Satan, the enemy, in the Battle of Armageddon.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>So we have two different events.  One is Jesus rapturing the saints and, the next is the second coming of Christ, when He personally returns with the saints to conquer the anti-christ and set up His kingdom to rule the earth for 1,000 years. When will this happen? No one knows the day or hour for He comes like a thief in the night. (Hebrews 9:28)</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Are there any signs to know when Christ is coming?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Blessed is the one who reads the word of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.&quot; Revelation1:3</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>There are many signs mentioned in the Bible referring to Christ&apos;s coming.  God used the prophets to share the scenarios of the last days. John, the last surviving disciple of the twelve, is an elderly man when an angel of the Lord gives him a vivid look at the future as written in the Book of Revelation.  Specifically, in chapter 6, he writes of the seven seals that are opened describing the last days.  Below are other prophetic clues to look for in the last days.

1.Parable of the fig tree (see question 1 on this topic) when Israel became a state in 1948 (Matthew 24:32)
2.In June of 1967 Israel invaded and took back Jerusalem in a matter of days. (Daniel 9:25)
3.The European Union uses the Euro as their currency today (Daniel 7:7 speaks of the EU as a beast with 10 horns symbolizing the 10 countries in the EU)
4.The anti-christ will be a world leader requiring his mark of 666 on the right hand or forehead. Individuals without the mark will not be able to buy or sell. (Revelation 13:16-18)  His master plan is to look as if he is offering peace and prosperity, but it is all part of a greater deception. He will ultimately want us to worship him and will put his image in the temple of Jerusalem
5.A powerful Russia will invade Israel (Ezekiel Chapters 38 &amp; 39; Gog &amp; Magog)
6.The Euphrates River will dry up and allow the armies of the east (i.e. a powerful China) to invade Israel (Revelation 16:12, Kings of the East)
7.A powerful Iran will invade Israel. The Bible refers to Iran as the whore of Babylon because of her great evil (Revelation 17)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>No one knows for sure when Christ is coming, but the Bible gives us knowledge to watch and pray. In the end, all the invaders of Israel will be totally destroyed by Jesus Christ and His armies of Heaven.  God loves Israel and will redeem her always.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>When Christ returns will the earth really be destroyed?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.&quot; Ecclesiastes 1:4

&quot;He set the earth on its foundations, it can never be moved.&quot; Psalm 104:5

&quot;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.&quot; Revelation 21:1-2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Yes and no.  The earth will be destroyed by pestilence, earthquakes, fires and all kinds of wrath, including the Battle of Armageddon, but when Christ comes to defeat Satan and reign as Lord of Lords, He will set up a new earth and its capital will be Jerusalem.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The Book of Revelation describes the beautiful, new Jerusalem on the new earth.  It is amazing and full of the splendor of a lovely bride as she greets her bride groom on their wedding day. On this day, God will dwell with His people and wipe their every tear. All the older things will pass away. Read Revelation, Chapters 21 and 22.  It describes a wonderful earth and heaven.  We should strive to see it first hand by knowing Christ is King!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the tribulation and will Christ save us from it?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.&quot; Matthew 24:21

&quot;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on the forehead, or on the hand, he, too, will drink of the wine of God&apos;s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and of the Lamb.&quot; Revelation 14: 9-10

&quot;Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.&quot; Revelation 3:10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Matthew 24:12 in the King James Version of the Bible calls the &quot;great distress&quot; the tribulation, which as you can read in scripture, is a time of torment for individuals (especially those that take the mark of the beast as described in question 3 in this topic). Those that do not keep the command to endure, take the mark and ultimately denounce Christ, having to face judgment.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>This question is one of great debate among theologians.  Some believe we will be raptured before the tribulation, some believe we will be raptured in the middle of the tribulation, while others believe we will have to endure the trial before being raptured.  Others do not even recognize the rapture as described in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 of the Bible. Whether or not believers in Christ acknowledge the rapture, rarely do believers argue the coming wrath of God&apos;s judgment as described in the Book of Revelation.  Christ will be REDEEMED. Personally this author believes Rev. 3:10 as a promise from God. If we keep the command to endure knowing Christ alone as our savior, He will keep the hour of trial from coming upon thee. The bottom line is to keep Christ FIRST, forsaking all others for HIM.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the difference between Bible Creationism and Evolution?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, &quot;Let there be light, and there was light.&quot; Genesis 1:1-3</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This scripture gives us three great truths which are the foundations of biblical creationism and the Christian faith. First, we learn of the oneness of God which contrasts the theory of many Gods or modern humanist philosophies. Second, we learn of the personality and attributes of God as an imminent figure that created the world and is in the world too. Last, we learn of the omnipotence of God in contrast to the idols that modern humanists hang on to and worship. This one verse tells us that God is eternal—He was before, is now, and always will be—and that He created all that is out of nothing by His spoken word. Evolution is the belief that the universe started from nothing with a &quot;big bang&quot; and has been evolving ever since. It is a scientific perspective whereas Bible Creationism is a supernatural perspective.  Each offers what they consider to be valuable truths, but Christians know that biblical creationism answers fundamental questions of human existence that evolution cannot.</string>

				<string>How did God create man and woman?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;--- the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.&quot; Genesis 2:7
The LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a helper suitable him.&quot; Genesis 2:18
&quot;So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man&apos;s ribs and closed up the pace with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.&quot; Genesis 2:21-22.</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God created man from the dust of the ground and then, not wanting the man to be alone, he created woman from man by taking a rib. God&apos;s spoken word was the catalyst to create both man and woman. From His word came the action of creation.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>We were created by God in a supernatural way. When we look at our bodies it is astonishing at the engineering that went into making us. Even more impressive is the mental ability He gave each of us. We are conscious. What an absolute miracle that is! Each one of us is incredibly different. And yet we are the same in many ways. A scientist clones a sheep and we are impressed. But God managed to devise a way to make no two people exactly the same. Now, that is one major achievement. Thank God for your unique body and mind. You are a masterpiece created by the MASTER!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why would God create such an evil being like Satan?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings. By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.  All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.&quot;  Ezekiel 28:15-20</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible tells us The Lord created Satan and made him a guardian cherub which was a powerful position from God. The Lord made Satan a beautiful creature and adorned him in precious jewels. The Lord DID NOT create Satan as an evil being for he was blameless at creation. The Bible clearly tells us Satan sinned against God.  Satan&apos;s heart became proud on account of his beauty. The Lord expelled Satan from His presence.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God created a beautiful angel and NOT Satan. Pride came and then came Satan&apos;s fall.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>When God created the world in six days are they 24 hour days?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.&quot; Genesis 2:1-2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>In order to answer this question we must look at the Hebrew word for &quot;day&quot; and the context in which it appears in Genesis. The Hebrew word &quot;Yom&quot; means a literal 24 hour period of time. In these verses it is used in conjunction with ordinal numbers (i.e. the seventh day). Yom plus a number indicates an ordinary 24 hour day.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Yes, God meant 24 hour days when He created the world in six days. According to Exodus 20:9-11, God used six literal days to create the world in order to serve as a model for man&apos;s workweek: work six days, rest one. Certainly God could have created everything in an instant if He wanted to. But apparently He had us in mind even before He made us (on the sixth day) and wanted to provide an example for us to follow.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the age of the earth?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth. After Seth was born Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.&quot; Genesis 5:3-5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Seth was born to Adam and Eve after their first son Cain killed his brother Abel and was banished from the Lord&apos;s presence, then the genealogy as listed in Genesis chapters 5 and 11 provide the age at which Adam and his descendants each fathered the next generation in an ancestral time line from Adam to Abraham. By determining where Abraham fits into history chronologically and adding up the ages provided in Genesis 5 and 11, it becomes apparent that the Bible teaches the earth to be about 6000 years old, give or take a few hundred years.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Given the fact that, according to the Bible, Adam was created on the sixth day of our planet&apos;s existence, we can determine a biblically-based, approximate age for the earth by looking at the chronological details of the human race. This assumes that the Genesis account is accurate, that the six days of creation were literal 24-hour periods, and that there were no gaps in the chronology of Genesis. Our beliefs about the age of the earth rest on our faith of the scriptures.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I overcome my fears?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.&quot; 1 John 4:18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>His love is the kind of love that makes you warm and protected. It is as if He is reaching His everlasting arms about you in a loving embrace. It takes all fear away for it cannot exist in His love. No one is perfect. God knows this and for this reason He has liberally sprinkled encouragement against fear throughout the Bible. Beginning in the book of Genesis and continuing throughout the book of Revelation, God reminds us to &quot;Fear not.&quot;</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Even if your walk with Christ is strong, it does not make you immune to attacks of fear. Remember David, the boy who slayed the giant, and then later became king? He had many times where he feared his enemies and God was with him.  He was encouraged by the Lord and wrote, &quot;In God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?&quot; (Psalms 56:11)This is an awesome testimony to the power of trusting in God. Regardless of what happened, David would trust in God because he knew and understood the power of God. The key to overcoming fear is total and complete trust in God. Trusting God is a refusal to give in to fear. It is turning to God even in the darkest times and trusting Him to make things right. This trust comes from knowing God and knowing that He is good. As Job said when he was experiencing some of the most difficult trials recorded in the Bible, &quot;Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him&quot; (Job 13:15 NKJV). </string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>I am afraid of many things, does God know or care about my fears?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don&apos;t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.&quot; Matthew 10:29-31</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus spoke these comforting words.  You are valuable, worthy and known by God.  Imagine a bird cannot fall without God knowing.  And as Jesus said birds are of no value, but you are precious. So precious that Jesus died for your sins and He understands your fears.  He knew death was a BIG fear, so He took it for you. His eye is on the sparrow and His eye is on you too.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Jesus was walking with the disciples witnessing the miracles he performed and yet they still feared. When a storm approached at sea they woke Jesus asking him how he could sleep in such a storm.  He said to the disciples, &quot;Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?&quot; (Mark 4:40) If the disciples could fear even with Jesus sleeping in their boat, then it is realistic to believe that we will fear.  But be encouraged that with faith you can jump in the boat with Jesus who calls you friend, cares, knows and wants to conquer your fears.  Will you jump in the boat with Him? Grab a section of your hair and try to count the strands.  It is impossible to imagine knowing the total number of hairs on your head. What a God!  Read Deuteronomy 33:26-29 and replace your name for Israel and Jacob and be encouraged by the Lord.  He loves you so!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Does God cause fear?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him will cry, &apos;Abba, Father&apos; &quot; Romans 8:15

&quot;For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and self-discipline.&quot; 2 Timothy 1:7</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Christ died so that you would be free from fear and delivered into a spirit of power by the Holy Spirit.  The only fear related to God is a &quot;fear of God&quot; which is meant to keep our life aligned to His purpose. (see question #5 in this topic). God wants us to have courage, love and sound mind to overcome all fears.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Fear is Satan&apos;s greatest weapon over us. Satan is the master at using our fears to stop us, bind us, and rob us.  Where there is great fear you will find him scheming, but on the bright side when we are overwhelmed with fear it usually means he is threatened by our potential and his only defense is to try to stop you.  So, go on and witness, go on and give God the glory. You are free in Christ.
Recognize the ways he tries to thwart the free life in Christ. Bind the enemy in Jesus&apos; name.
1. He uses our past sins 
2. He uses the possibilities of the future 
3. He uses the potential of failure 
4. He uses the certainty of criticism</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Was Jesus ever afraid?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. No, it is for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!&quot; John 12:27-28</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This was Jesus speaking to a crowd after he went into Jerusalem to face his death. After speaking this aloud, a voice came from Heaven saying, &quot;I have glorified it, and will glorify it again&quot;. The crowd said it thundered and many thought an angel had spoken.  Jesus said this voice was for their benefit and not mine. Then, the judgment of the world was at hand and the Prince of the world was driven out for our sakes.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>On two occasions in the Gospel we see Jesus afraid, here and also at the Garden of Gethsemane where he says, &quot;my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death&quot; (Mark14:34). On each of the two occasions he prayed to his Father and in prayer he got the strength to continue and face the difficult situation. In Gethsemane, the night before his crucifixion he prayed and an angel of the Lord ministered to Him. Imagine Jesus saying &quot;Now my soul is troubled and my soul is overwhelmed.&quot; It is shocking that the Son of God was afraid, but he was flesh like us, but his response was perfect, unlike us. He paid the price for us.

Two BIG messages here regarding fear:  1) if Jesus was afraid, we too can count on being afraid at some point; 2) when we encounter fear, how do we handle it…on our knees in prayer.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does it mean to fear the Lord?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Humility and the fear of the Lord bring honor, wealth, and life.&quot; Proverbs 22:7

&quot;Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.&quot; Proverbs 9:10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>What a gift to have knowledge, honor, wealth and life! In order to have that we must keep two conditions: humility and fear of the Lord. &quot;God fearing&quot; is a term you don&apos;t hear so much these days, but it is still a valuable characteristic used to describe people who honor God and others according to the principle we have heard lately &quot;I am second&quot; because serving Christ should be our first priority.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Christ did not want us to be held captive in a spirit of fear, but fearing the Lord is different. A fear of the Lord means you have profound love and respect for God. It means you take God seriously. It is having an attitude that you know God is watching your every action and motive; hearing your every thought. Fearing the Lord means to love what God loves, and hate what he hates. Just like having respect for your parent’s rules and fearing them enough to follow their guidance.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why should I forgive someone?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.&quot;  Matthew 6:14-15</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>We must always remember that we are supposed to forgive others because we have been forgiven (if you are a Christian).  Jesus has very strong words for someone who will not forgive someone who has hurt them when God has already forgiven them.  We must keep that in perspective.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Pray that God would change your heart so that you can truly forgive and not hold a grudge.</string>

				<string>What does it mean to forgive someone?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord.  I will put my laws in their hearts and I will write them on their minds.  Then he adds: &quot;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.&quot;  And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.&quot; Hebrews 10:16-18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>To forgive someone means to give up resentment towards someone or to not get back at someone who has wronged you or hurt you.  You can see in this verse that part of forgiving someone is to not remember it anymore.  You must make peace with the person who has wronged you as well as refuse to remember what they did to wrong you.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Pray that God will teach you how to forgive like He forgave you.  It may seem impossible to forget what they have done to hurt you right now.  Actively pray against remembering the hurt, believing God will restore your relationship with that person.</string>

				<string>How many times do I have to forgive someone?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, &apos;I repent&apos;, &apos;forgive him.&apos;&quot; Luke 17:4</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>&quot;Even though this is counter-cultural, God says to forgive someone no matter how many times they have wronged you.  We tend to think that we can forgive someone one time and then if they hurt us again then we don&apos;t have to forgive them, but God&apos;s love is unconditional.  We must continue to forgive those who hurt us because we are also forgiven.&quot;</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Pray that God will give you the ability to continually forgive them.  It seems silly to our world to continually forgive someone, but we are to always forgive when they come to us seeking forgiveness for that is not of the &quot;world&quot;, and as Christians we are not to be of the world, but of Lord.</string>

				<string>You don&apos;t understand what they did to me. I don&apos;t think I can forgive them. What should I do?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.&quot; Colossians 3:13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>It is evident that our world is broken and we are always getting hurt, but this is never an excuse to not forgive someone.  It can take a long time to rebuild a relationship and rebuild trust, but we have to be willing to forgive others EVEN IF it takes a little while.  This is not permission to hold onto a grudge, but as we pray and ask God to help us forgive them, He can work supernaturally.  This is actually one of the biggest ways that Christ is shown to people who do not know Jesus – instead of getting back or getting even, we forgive as Christ forgave us.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Pray that God would really change your heart and remove the bitterness that is so easy to get wrapped up in when we have been wronged.  Pray also for an eternal perspective rather than focusing on the here and now, because God is in control and has a great plan for you through forgiveness.</string>

				<string>God tells us that he has provided forgiveness for all sins through the death of Jesus (see the SAVED topic), so this verse is a promise that if we confess our sins to him, then he will forgive us.  Forgiveness has been provided, and we can know that we are forgiven if we truly ask God with a sincere heart to forgive us of our sins.</string>

				<string>My guilt overwhelms me, how can I let it go?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.&quot; Hebrews 8:12</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Even if you have been wicked in sin and have repented to the Lord for forgiveness, He will forget it forever. Why can`t you?</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving (at least that&apos;s what I say).  Personally, this writer struggles with whether I have been the best friend, the best mother, the best wife, the best daughter, best sister, the best Christian…. I allow my unreasonable standards to guilt me into enabling habits because I believe the lie of the enemy at such times. I haven&apos;t accidentally run over someone with my car or caused an employee to get fired; yet, my guilt tries to consume me to the brink of calamity. Some reading this may have such catastrophic guilt from tragic circumstances beyond or within their control. The point is -- Satan wants you to be defeated by your thoughts and fears. There is no guilt in Christ.  If your guilt stems from sin, repent and forget. I can assure you God has forgotten.</string>

				<string>What does the Bible say about forgiving yourself?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Since you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.&quot; Colossians 3:1-2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>We must rise above to higher thoughts and put our minds on Christ. The Bible tells us to forgive others (See Forgiveness Topic), but it says nothing about forgiving ourselves. We are told to ask forgiveness and have trust in Christ to rise above our own feelings of worthlessness.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Guilt is failing to forgive ourselves and keeping it alive in our memory. Remembering our sins is only beneficial when it reminds us of God&apos;s forgiveness and makes it easier for us to forgive others. (Matthew 18:21-35) In the same way, each time we mentally relive our sin, we commit the same sin over again. If this is happening in a Christian`s life, the pattern of sin/guilt/sin/guilt can be destructive and never-ending. You are raised with Christ, rise above the guilt!</string>

				<string>Why I am feeling guilty when I have done nothing wrong?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.&quot; Roman 6:10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>You have to accept Christ&apos;s atonement and what He did on the cross for you. Christ died once for all that we might have everlasting life and freedom from guilt and the bondage to sin.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>If you have done nothing wrong, yet you struggle with guilt, you suffer from false guilt. Chances are you have an overactive conscience which is not happy at rest. Though rest is the birthright of the Christian, relaxing is just too dangerous for you because you must be ever fearful of letting someone down and must constantly work to gain acceptance. You are just worn out. Does this describe you? Accept once and for all that you are accepted by Christ. You will never be perfect. What you are doing wrong is putting your trust in the acceptance of the world. Make Jesus your world.</string>

				<string>What can guilt do to us?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I have sinned&quot;, he said, &quot;For I have betrayed innocent blood.&quot; Matthew 27:4

&quot;So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.&quot; Matthew 27:5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>These verses pertain to the betrayal of Christ by Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples.  He turned Jesus into the chief priests for thirty coins. His guilt consumed him and he took his life.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>One might say for a disciple of Christ to do such an act, he must have been drawn in by the schemes of Satan. Yes, Satan took over Judas and tries to take us over with temptations he places before us. But James 4:7 says, &quot;Submit to God – resist the devil and he will flee from you&quot;. The best way to keep the devil from entering your life is to draw closer to God. The enemy will try to guilt you into the chains of fear and helplessness. Once a friend shared what God showed her one day in prayer:  He told her the devil is L I V E D backwards. He is all lived up; don&apos;t let him take your life with him. LIVE in the present tense.</string>

				<string>&quot;Then this is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.&quot; 1 John 3:19-20</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Our own hearts condemn us. We must belong to the truth and rest in HIS presence for God is greater than our matters of the heart.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God is the greatest cardiac thoracic surgeon in the world. Not only can He repair your broken heart (after all He made it), but He knows just what to take out to make it mend. He removes your guilt, shame, fear and failure completely because you belong to Him. Are you in need of a heart surgeon? Does your heart ache over guilt? Have you set an appointment with the Great Physician to discuss your problems? If not, you should. It is no charge. Jesus already paid the bill for you.</string>

				<string>How do I get to Heaven?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; John 14:6</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This was Jesus&apos; response to the disciple Thomas when he questioned how to know the way to go to be with his Lord.  In the preceding verses, Jesus had been speaking of going to Heaven and the disciples wanted desperately to follow their Lord. Jesus told them how to get to Heaven and be with him. The only way is through me he said.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>You can&apos;t get to Heaven by just being good or doing good things such as serving as a volunteer.  Those are all great things and worthy of reward once you GET to Heaven.  But, to get to Heaven, you must know Jesus as your Lord and Savior, and recognize that you are a sinner. And as a sinner you need his grace to save you.  Do you know him? If you don&apos;t, would you like to? Welcome him in your life today.

				<string>Is Heaven real?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into Heaven and he sat at the right hand of God&quot; Mark 16:19</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Yes, there is a heaven. Jesus not only went before us, he went FOR us. He is alive and serving as King with God.  Heaven is not the white clouds and harp that you see on TV or on the internet. Heaven is where God lives with his son.  Life in Heaven is all about God. It is forever and unshakeable.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>What&apos;s real in your life? The love of friends and family? You can&apos;t see it, but you know it&apos;s there. Heaven is the same. It exists. God, your heavenly father loves you, just as your friends and family do.

Pray to Jesus to feel his love, it is REAL!</string>

				<string>Where is Heaven?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.&quot; Luke 9:51

&quot;Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves.&quot; Mark 6:41</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus referred to Heaven as being &quot;up&quot; in direction. We do not know whether it is a place &quot;in the heavens&quot; (the universe beyond the Earth) or outside space and time as we know it. We do know Heaven is some place based on the word of God through scriptures such as these. In addition, people have shared their experiences as they were dying and visualized Heaven. They returned to tell their stories, but that place described wasn&apos;t Earth.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>To understand the exact location is not for us to know until God reveals it to us. Our goal should be to strive to get there when our time on earth has come to an end. Until then, it is beyond our imagination!  

To read more about Heaven the actual place, check out these Bible verses: John 1:32, 6:33, 6:42, 18:36; Matthew 28:2; Acts 1:2; Revelation 10:1.</string>

				<string>&quot;In my Father&apos;s house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.&quot;  John 14:2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus spoke of Heaven often and in this verse he describes it as a vast place for all that follow him.  Heaven has been described as a beautiful city of pure gold where you will rest and fellowship in love and joy.  It is a place of worship and a great reward.  Heaven is all these things and more!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>You&apos;ve heard the phrase, &quot;It was like Heaven&quot; or the song, &quot;Almost Heaven&quot;. These comparisons use Heaven as a term to describe wonderful things or experiences. Heaven is simply Heaven! It is beautiful, marvelous, phenomenal, amazing…get the picture?

To read more about what Heaven is like, check out these Bible verses:  Matthew 5:11; John 14:3; Hebrews 11:16; Revelation 15:4, 20:2, 21:4, 21:18-21.</string>

				<string>Will I know anyone in Heaven?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham&apos;s side.  The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.&quot;  Luke 16:22-23</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>In this historical account of the afterlife of a rich man and Lazurus, a beggar, Jesus used their proper names to show it was not just an example or parable. The rich man recognized the beggar that once lay outside his gate on Earth. The verse goes on to describe the scene. Now in hell, the man is seeing Lazarus in Heaven, as he looks up, begs him to give him drink for his burning lips and begs him to warn his five brothers to avoid the torment he has come to know in hell.  Even in hell, we do not necessarily lose our memories of our families on Earth or acquaintances.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Yes, if your loved one has died and knew Jesus Christ as his or her personal Savior here on Earth, you will see them in Heaven!  Make sure you share this scripture with your loved ones, so they can avoid the eternal torment that the rich man suffers.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Is there really a hell?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.&quot; Revelation 1:18
 
&quot;The lake of fire is the second death.  If anyone’s name is not found in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&quot; Revelation 20:14-15</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Hell is referred to as Hades and also Abaddon in the Bible. It is also known as the lake of fire. It is a real place. In contrast to the gods of paganism, Christ possesses life in the essential nature (He is alive) and He has total dominion (control) over death and hell.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>At the end of time we will all stand before judgment and the people whose names are in the Book of Life (those believers in Christ Jesus) will be in heaven forever and ever and those people whose names are not in the Book of Life will be cast into hell.  If we believe what the living God says, then we do know that hell is a very real place. As a born again Christian, His simple plan of salvation given to us with the spilling of His blood will allow us to live forever with Christ and our loved ones in heaven.  The Lion of Judah, The Bright and Morning Star will hold and keep your soul and your immortal body intact and you will live for eternity! Amen.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Where is hell?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men. What does he ascended mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions. He who descended is the very on who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.&quot; Ephesians 7:10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible states that after his death, Jesus descended into Hell. But his soul did not remain there, nor did his body decay, he ascended with captives on the tail of His rope to Heaven. The implication is that Hell is located underground, apparently in a cavern deep under the surface of the earth. Also, consider the scripture in the Heaven topic: Luke 16:22-23, where Lazarus looked up from hell and saw Abraham.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Hell is a place below and beneath the earth. Symbolically it is literally the lowest of low, beneath you and me. As Christians we are above it and ascending even higher in Christ one day.</string>

				<string>What is hell like?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars – their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.&quot; Revelation 21:8</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Hell will be hot, in the Scriptures; one of the most common attributes mentioned about Hell is its high temperature. In order for sulfur to form a lake, it must be molten. Thus, its temperature must be at or below 444.6° C or 832° F. That is the boiling point of sulfur. Those that do not know Christ will not escape the fire.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Hell is a place of torment and bondage. According to Matthew 8:12, it is also dark and according to Mark 9:44, there will be flesh eating worms. It is such a horrible place that it has been made a curse word. In anger it is spewed from mouths to condemn others knowing that telling someone &quot;to go to hell&quot; is the worst possible destination. The only way to avoid going is to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior. (See Saved Topic)</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Does Satan live in hell?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;And the Lord said to Satan &quot;Where have you come from?&quot; Satan answered the Lord, &quot;From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.&quot; &quot; Job 2:2
&quot;Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.&quot; 1 Peter 5:8</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>References describing the abode of Satan are few but adequate to reveal the truth. In Job 1:7, Satan tells the Lord again that he is roaming the earth just like he told the Lord in Job 2:2, we find Satan coming to appear before God, and the LORD asks Satan a very pointed question. Satan&apos;s answer in both instances is that he is roaming about the earth. Also in 1 Peter he is prowling, so according to the Bible, Satan is nomadic and not in one place. Although he is on the earth, he is not the master &quot;the earth is the Lord&apos;s, and the fullness of the world, and they that dwell in it&quot; (Psalm 24:1).</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>It seems reasonable to us that Satan is in hell, but Scripture tells us otherwise. Yes, when Christ comes to conquer Satan he will throw him into the Lake of Fire for 1000 years, but right now he is walking about trying to accomplish his goal to defeat God&apos;s kingdom which is us.  He will not succeed for the Bible tells us so! Resist the enemy and flee from him when he tries to come to visit. (See Ephesians 2:2 for more Scriptures about where Satan travels)</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I avoid hell?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; Romans 8:37-39</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This is a remarkable scripture. NOTHING can keep you from eternal life in Heaven as long as you ARE IN CHRIST JESUS.  If you believe Jesus died for you that is your key to His kingdom in Heaven…he took the key from hell for you. (See Question 1 on Hell Topic)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Many people worry that their sin is so great that it cannot keep them from hell. Sincerely, if you know Jesus, your sin cannot keep you from Heaven. (See Sin, Saved, and Heaven Topics for more information on this subject)</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>When I have lost hope, what do I do?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.&quot; Psalm 42:11</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>David, the psalmist, posed this question and found his answer in God. For your hope is in the Almighty Savior and when you lose hope praise Him. Your praise will elevate Him in worship and elevate you at the same time.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>If anyone had reason to lose hope it was David.  His best friend&apos;s father was trying to kill him and he had to leave his family and home. He spent years fighting battles and felt the presence of his enemies all about him. These were just some of the many reasons he had to lose hope, but his hope was in God. He worshipped with the most heartfelt emotions making the Book of Psalms a pure and true open dialog between a once shepherd boy and his savior. God made him a powerful King and a mighty nation! Read the Psalms (Psalm 61 if crying out in hopelessness) and worship your Lord for He is your hope.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is my hope as a Christian?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;----the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel that has come to you.&quot; Colossians 1:5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Our hope is the combination of faith and love that we have as believers in Christ knowing that no matter what this world holds our promise given to us by the gospel according to God is eternal life in Heaven. (See Heaven topic and read how lovely it will be)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Colossians 1:5 says our hope is stored in Heaven. What images come to mind when you think about hope being stored? Is it an image of a hope chest, full of beautiful memories and things? Think about that concept in general.  If you could take every moment of optimism, expectation, anticipation, wishful thinking, or idealistic dream and place it in a sacred location comprised of precious gold and jewels where choirs of angels saturate the atmosphere with music as you bask in the glory of God with all your senses heightened to smell, taste, see, hear, and touch the utter splendor of hope itself…Jesus! Wow! What a hope chest that would be!  Guess what? Hope in Jesus is the real deal!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What happens when I put my hope in people/things and not in God?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;----remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the word. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.&quot; Ephesians 2:12-13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Paul was speaking to the church in Ephesus about the hopelessness they faced believing somehow they could save themselves. They were lost separated from Christ, but now in Jesus, they can place their trust knowing hope is possible and claim citizenship in Him. Peace comes as a citizen of Christ. A promise of hope by the ultimate promise keeper—Jesus.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>How often do we place our hopes in people thinking they can save us? If I could just get that recommendation from so and so, I know the job will be mine.  If I screw up, my mom will take care of it for me.  If my church leader lets me go on this mission trip, my good deeds will make up for all my sin. When we place our hope in people and the ways of the world we will always be disappointed. Did you pray asking God first, before putting your hope in the circumstances?  Ultimately, you are saying, &quot;God you don&apos;t matter as much as______&quot;. I challenge you to place your hopes in God for whatever you are looking people to fill. Let Him fill you with overflowing living water that quenches every thirst and every hope. 

Jesus, I place my hope in you and you alone. You are not like a man that lies. You keep your promises. And your promise means you will not disappoint or abandon me. Thank you Lord, Amen.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the difference between faith and hope?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.&quot; Romans 8:24-25

&quot;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.&quot; Hebrews 11:1</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Hope is a confident expectation regarding things unclear or unknown. Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. So hope is the expectation and faith is the assurance the expectation will be fulfilled.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Here is an example of faith and hope coming together. I hope (confident expectation) that this application will glorify the Lord and I stand in faith (patient assurance) that many will come to know Jesus more intimately with i Dial Jesus.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the difference between the Old and New Testaments as it pertains to hope?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Therefore, since we have such a hope we are very bold. We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away. But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.&quot; 2 Corinthians 3:12-14</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Christ is the difference. The old covenant separated us from the glory of God. A veil had to come between us and God. The new covenant (when Christ died for our sins and became the lamb shedding his blood for us) gave hope to the sinner. The veil in the temple was torn literally from top to bottom, no longer separating us from the glory of God. Christ&apos;s death gave us access to go directly to Him.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Christ gave you full access to hope. It didn&apos;t use to be that way. Priests would have to bring an animal to the altar and offer it as a blood sacrifice to God. They were the only ones allowed access behind the curtain to enter the holy of holies before the Lord. The veil was torn and the sacrifice was made on your behalf. Go directly to the King of Kings. It was His gift to you. Claim your authority in Christ to be bold in hope.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does God say about jealousy?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;You shall not covet your neighbor&apos;s wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor&apos;s house or land, his manservant or maid servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&quot; Deuteronomy 5:21</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This is the 10th commandment given by the Lord to Moses.  God commands us to stay away from jealousy.  It is a sin.  Today we don&apos;t relate to the term ox or manservant, but we can relate to cars and maids.  God tells us not to covet or be jealous for other people&apos;s things.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Many have become content to &quot;want&quot; for things as if they were &quot;needs&quot; which are not same. We are surrounded by advertisements, celebrity magazines and movies that feed us full of desires to want material things and relationships with people that are rooted out of a jealous nature. &quot;A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.&quot; (Proverbs: 14:30) God says envy/jealousy makes us rotten. Try to be content with what you have and pray that the Lord will help you fight the desires to want what everyone else has. 

Spend time serving the poor.  In blessing them, you will be blessed, and soon your wants will seem less important.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why am I jealous of other people?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely? But he gives us more grace…&quot; James 4:5-6</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>In us lives a free will to be jealous and envious. God knows this and scripture addresses it because it is a big issue to face as a Christian, but God gives us grace and forgives us.  Later in verse 6, HE asks us to submit to HIM and resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>We are human and &quot;of the flesh&quot; as the Bible would say.  We are sinners and we want the BMW Jessica drives, or the popularity Nick has, or the slim body Jordan has…the list goes on and on.  And Jesus&apos; grace goes on and on.  His grace is without end.  Submit yourselves before HIM asking with a sincere heart to rise above jealousy.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I control my jealous nature?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love him and show myself to him.&quot; John 14:21

&quot;Be still before the Lord….do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.&quot; Proverbs 37:7</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>&quot;Do not covet&quot; (or be jealous) is the 10th commandment and Jesus tells us to keep his commandments.  Also, we are to wait for the Lord for our needs and not to worry for successes or potentially jealous things we want that make us have a jealous spirit.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Controlling our nature to die to sin is the most difficult part of living a Christian life.  If our desire is to please the Lord, then we desire to keep his commandments and obey them.  HE will show us HIS love and HE will fill those empty places that make us long for the wrong things.  We have to recognize that jealousy brings out wickedness.  Pray: Jesus, I can&apos;t control my jealous heart, but you can. Your word says you are jealous for me to find you and love you.  Make my desires your desires. AMEN.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Does my jealousy affect other people?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.&quot; James 5:26

&quot;For where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice.&quot; James 3:16</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Yes, jealousy provokes others. It causes chaos in people. Also, it makes evil reside in its presence.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend that was easily upset when you spent time with other people? Maybe you struggle with jealousy when your friends spend time outside your company. Why is that? It could be insecurity or fear. Inevitably, in those situations, someone ends up upset over words said and things done by the jealous party as they try to control or manipulate the other person.  Healthy relationships cannot exist in the presence of evil and jealousy is evil.  After all, it does answer to the name &quot;green-eyed monster&quot;.  Open the door to your heart, give it to God and say good-bye before it tries to bring you down and everyone else in your path.</string>

				<string>Do you know who is jealous for you?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Do not worship any other gods, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.&quot; Exodus 34:14

&quot;For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin before him. But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent&apos;s cunning, your mind may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.&quot; 2 Corinthians 11:3</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God is jealous for you.  He wants your worship and devotion. God wants you to want HIM as much as HE wants you.  In the scripture from Paul, he speaks of Christ as the bridegroom and you are the bride.  He desires you come to HIM with your whole heart, body and soul.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>We can easily be led astray by distractions of life. A Godly jealousy is the best possible kind of jealous.  God&apos;s jealousy is IN LOVE.  Right now, tell the Lord how you love HIM and appreciate HIS unfailing love for you even when you don&apos;t deserve it. Ask HIM to show you how to love HIM more.</string>

				<string>What does it mean to be a Christian Leader?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.&quot; John 10:11</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus Christ refers to himself as the Shepherd. The Shepherd has responsibility for his sheep. This includes such things as feeding them, comforting them, protecting them, and leading them. Jesus leads his &quot;flock&quot; (children) by modeling godliness and righteousness in his own life and encouraging others to follow his example. Christian leaders serve with compassion, patience, encouragement, and discipline.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Pray that God will teach you how to model leadership through the example He gave us in His Son Jesus Christ.  Leadership is a position of humble, loving service.  Can you choose to serve others before serving yourself? How does it make you feel when you apply this philosophy? Remember what your grandmother always said at Christmas, &quot;it is better to give than to receive&quot;. This is the foundation of Christian Leadership.</string>

				<string>&quot;Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves; but our competence comes form God.&quot; 2 Corinthians 3:5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Leadership is not given through a title, but when someone is already doing the work of a leader and has the character of a leader. Leadership is demonstrated before you are recognized as a leader.  God has given each of us a gift, such as a beautiful voice, or the ability to write stories, or to calculate math problems in our head. Leadership is another of these gifts. God chooses his leaders. You did not choose me, but I chose you (John 15:16). This fact alone rules out leadership based on seniority, degrees earned, prestige in the community, or personal friendships.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Do you know what gift God has blessed you with? (See My Gifts Topic) Could it be Leadership? Think of situations that you have found yourself in with your friends or family.  When difficult situations arise, are you an Upstander or a Bystander?</string>

				<string>What is Servant Leadership?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.&quot; Proverbs 27:2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Servant leadership is one of the most popular leadership models around today. The concept was developed by Robert K. Greenleaf in 1970.  The servant leader serves the person he/she leads which implies that employees, fellow students, are the focus rather than the ultimate end goal (said another way:  people first).  Servant leaders devote themselves to serving the needs of the student body, friends or youth organizations. They focus on meeting the needs of those they lead; they develop others to bring out the best in them; they coach/mentor others; they encourage self expression; they facilitate personal growth in all who work with them; and they listen and build a sense of community.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Do you lead by your conscience, your inward moral sense of what is right and what is wrong?  Morality is really the overlapping between the law and behavior.  When making decisions do you consider what is kind and what is unkind; what contributes and what detracts; what adds beauty and what destroys it; what is true and what is false?  These are leadership skills that you can start to practice today! Go ahead, I dare you to set yourself apart.  Servant leadership can start with your family.</string>

				<string>Will my ego hurt me as a leader?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.&quot; Matthew 23:12</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Ego focuses on one&apos;s own survival, pleasure or winning at the detriment of others.  Ego is selfish ambition, fulfilling ones own agenda. Ego is threatened by negative feedback, it make us look at the facts in a way that protects us (self-preservation). An ego left unchecked can be a disaster for you and your relationships.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>In order to keep your ego in the background, you must rethink your leadership style.  Rather than using power and authority over someone else, try using reasoning, persuasion, kindness, and empathy.  The result of such a modeled leadership style will be one built on trust and openness.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>My friends generally think of me as the leader.  Do I have to be perfect?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;You are the light of the world. A city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.&quot; Matthew 5:14-16</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Good friends inspire us. They don&apos;t hide their imperfections, but display how they trust God in the midst of them. Those friends who appear faultless intimidate us. An effective leader needs to be real and this means acknowledging our weaknesses and mistakes.  Leaders share their troubles and are able to be a good follower too.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>No one is perfect, except our Savior Jesus Christ. If you will trust in the word of the Lord, through reading and understanding of the Gospel, you can aspire to be as much like Christ as possible. This does not come easily or at once. We must grow in our spiritual maturity. Just as we expect different behavior from a baby, a child, a teenager, and an adult, so God expects different behavior from us, depending our spiritual development.  We are all sinners saved by grace.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does loving like God require of me?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?&apos; Jesus replied: &apos;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Matthew 22:36-39</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>As a followers of Jesus we are commanded to love, it&apos;s not a choice. If we call ourselves Christians, then we should strive to live our lives as a reflection of Jesus&apos; love. This means putting God first in our lives, and allowing His love to overwhelm us and fill every part of who we are. Then that same love should spill out of us onto others, loving them as we would want or desire for ourselves.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>As a follower of Jesus, loving others with Jesus&apos; love should become a natural part of who we are. If His love is a part of our character, then it shouldn&apos;t take too much effort to love even the difficult people in our lives. It&apos;s not about trying to be someone you&apos;re not, but honestly making love a foundational part of who you are.
In your encounters with people today, stop and ask God how you can demonstrate His love to them.</string>

				<string>How do I love God if I Can&apos;t see Him or touch Him?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see&quot;. Hebrews 11:1</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>If we were able to tangibly touch God or see Jesus in the flesh, then there would be no need for faith. God is bigger than we can comprehend, so it&apos;s silly to think that we could limit His greatness to our small lives and little understanding. Faith enables us to see God working in the lives of His people, and it is what gives us hope.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Love for God is different than the love you have for your family, or your boyfriend or girlfriend. It&apos;s a greater love than surpasses understanding, not a touchy-feely kind of love. We express our love for God through worship, prayer, spending quiet time with Him, serving Him, and loving others.
Pray that God would reveal Himself to you, so that you can experience His powerful love in your life.</string>

				<string>How can I have God&apos;s love in my life?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.&quot; 1 John 4:16</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The essence of who God is can be defined in one word: Love. Love is not just a characteristic of God, but He is the ultimate embodiment of love. It cannot be taken from God, which means that His love for us will never run out or disappear. We can always count on God, and when we love others, that is God living Himself out through us.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>When we go throughout our day loving others, it is not just being a good person, but it is God working in our lives. In which areas of your life do you need to express more love? When you allow love to win, that is giving God total control, and God reigns!
Tell God that you want to rely on Him and let love rule in your life.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Does God still love me if I sin?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Romans 5:8

&quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Christ Jesus our Lord&quot;. Romans 6:23

&quot;For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot; Romans 8:38-39</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>We all sin, but many times we sin even though our hearts know its wrong, or it &quot;just happened&quot;. All sins are contrary to Christ&apos;s character and deserve punishment. However, God still lavishes His love and blessings on us. He wants us to ask forgiveness of our sins and He will give us grace.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Grace does not give us permission to purposefully sin, as it&apos;s not freedom to indulge in sin, but rather a way to experience His love and live in the freedom we have in a relationship with God. Nothing can separate us from the love of God!
Take a moment to repent of sin in your life and thank God for His unconditional love.</string>

				<string>Do I have to love everyone?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;You have heard that it was said, &apos;Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&apos; But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&quot;. Matthew 5: 43-44</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Yes, we do have to love everyone. By doing so we are extending the grace and mercy that God gives us to those around us, regardless of the circumstance. God commands that his followers show grace and mercy to others and be representatives of His love even when those people seem unworthy of love or seem perhaps as enemies. We need to love everyone and leave the judgment up to God.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Allow love to define your life. Live your life for Christ and treat people with love and respect. You will be extending God&apos;s love to people, regardless of whether or not you think they deserve it. It&apos;s for all people, so show love in all situations, and let love and goodness win. For that is truly being Christ like.
Pray that God&apos;s love would touch others through you, genuinely and powerfully.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What are spiritual gifts?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.&quot;1 Corinthians 12: 7-11</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Holy Spirit works in each one of us in different ways. God has uniquely created each of us with gifts and abilities that contribute powerfully to the Church.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Discovering your spiritual gift is exciting and often confirmation for why you are wired a certain way. Whether it&apos;s an overwhelming feeling of compassion, or a desire to work behind the scenes, or it is a natural desire to lead a movement of people, all these point toward your God-given gifts. Examine your strengths, talents, and abilities and consider how they are to be used for His purposes. Pray and ask the Lord to show you your gifts and He will give you insight.</string>

				<string>Does God need me?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;…..all things were created by him and for him.&quot; Colossians 1:16

&quot;…I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.&quot; Ephesians 4:1

&quot;The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.&quot; Acts 17:24-25</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>All things point back to our Creator. God created all things which are to be used for His purposes. He did not uniquely create us so that we could turn from Him to serve other masters. All of creation should point back to and reflect Him, and make the most of the gift of life that He has given us, reflecting and representing Him well.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God doesn&apos;t need you as the passage in Acts 17:25 says, but he wants you. He is a jealous God, wanting you for His purposes and not serving worldly things. He wants you to be a recipient of His love, as God IS love and love is shared.  Jesus is the origin and purpose of all creation. He&apos;s created you and gifted you in such ways, so serving Him is to be your expression of love for Him. 
Consider how you could show God the fullest extent of your love by allowing Him to use you and mold you in new ways.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Are some gifts more important than others?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The eye cannot say to the hand, &quot;I don&apos;t need you!&quot; And the head cannot say to the feet, &quot;I don&apos;t need you!&quot; On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.&quot; 1 Corinthians 12: 21-26</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God has uniquely designed each of us and he gave each of us our gifts with equal value. Although some have been appointed as leaders and some serve less glamorously or behind the scenes; all parts contribute to the whole. The Body is comprised of all God&apos;s people and all are equally important despite our differences.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>As 1 Corinthians mentions, we all serve as different parts to the whole body. Imagine if we were all hands, or all feet? It wouldn&apos;t be a body, it would be a mess, and the parts wouldn&apos;t combine or function together. We all serve in varying roles and each part we play is important. We aren&apos;t to covet others gifts or think of our abilities as menial, rather, making the most of our talents and abilities to serve our God.
Pray that God would help you to see your giftedness as a crucial and powerful contributing factor in the body of Christ.</string>

				<string>What roles are listed as gifts in the Bible?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God&apos;s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.&quot; Ephesians 4:11-13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Most consider the list of spiritual gifts to include the following: prophecy, teaching, encouragement, giving, leadership, mercy, apostleship, prophesy, evangelism, shepherding, wisdom, knowledge, discernment, speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, and faith.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>What a fascinating realization that God has already appointed us to roles in serving Him. Many are revealed through time, and sometimes we see God giving us new giftedness and abilities in a season when we most need it in our lives. Utilizing our gifts enables us to experience spiritual maturity and growth, uniting us with fellow believers, and seeing more of the character of Christ.
Evaluate your life, and ask trusted believers in Christ for their input, on what your spiritual gifts may include. Often we are given more than one. Consider taking a spiritual gift assessment offered through your church.</string>

				<string>What impact does using my gifts play in the Kingdom?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.&quot; Ephesians 4:16

&quot;The one who calls is faithful and he will do it.&quot;  1 Thessalonians 5:24</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Using your gifts advances the Kingdom and spreads God&apos;s love to world. He only calls you to do what He gives you the ability to do. By using our gifts together we grow in fellowship with one another and develop strong community. Everyone contributes and is mutually encouraged.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Holding back and keeping your giftedness to yourself limits your potential and wastes opportunities to love others and spread the Gospel. If you aren&apos;t obedient to the call to use your gift, God will find someone else who will. Raise your hand and accept God&apos;s calling.  He gave you what you needed when He created you to fulfill that particular kingdom purpose. Why not acknowledge His gifts? So get out and spread His love with the world. More people will be able to hear about and experience God because of your contribution.
You are a kingdom worker, appointed by God for His service. Ask God how He can use you more powerfully to advance the Kingdom.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What kind of future does God want me to have?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For I know the plans I have for you,&quot; declares the Lord, &quot;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.&quot;  Jeremiah 29:11

&quot;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.&quot;  John 10:10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Both of these verses reveal to us that God knows the plans He has for us, that He desires for us to experience an abundant life, and that with Him we can always have hope.  The life that Jesus Christ gives us is richer and fuller, more satisfying.  It is eternal and it is full of Christ&apos;s love, forgiveness and guidance.  This does not mean that we will not experience pain, hardship, or suffering.  However, it does mean that even through difficult times that the Lord will walk through them with us and will make good even come out of the pain.  He never leaves us…ever.  He loves you and wants your future to include Him!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Lord Jesus, Thank you that you have plans to prosper me.  Help me to remember that You are always with me.  You are with me in the good times and with me in the bad times too.  Help me to be aware of your presence and help me to be satisfied in You alone.  I give my future to you and pray you would open my heart to receive it, open my ears to hear your direction, open my  hands to do your work and set my feet to follow the path you place before me.  My future is in YOU ALONE.  Amen.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What do I do when things don&apos;t happen the way I had planned for them to happen?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.&quot;  Hebrews 12:2-3</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>There are many times in life when things don&apos;t happen the way we hoped they would.  Here in Hebrews we are told how to handle the disappointment.  First, we fix our eyes on Jesus.  We focus our heart on Him.  We find comfort in knowing that He is the author of our lives and our faith, and there isn&apos;t anything that God starts that He doesn&apos;t finish.  We are encouraged by the truth that we have a God who understands our pain, heartache, and disappointment because He too came to earth and suffered.  We have a God who understands us.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>As you are confronted with heartache and disappointment, run to Jesus.  Share with Him your anger and your hurt.  He is big enough to take it, and honestly, He understands.  He went through it too.  If it helps, find a big rock that you can write on.  Write down what is bothering you, and then throw the rock in a pond or bury it in the ground.  As you drown the rock tell Jesus that you are giving your disappointment to Him and choosing to focus on His goodness rather than your disappointment.
Pray: Jesus, thank you for humbling yourself and coming to live on this earth, experiencing every hurt, pain and disappointment that I do.  I know that Your ways are not my ways and Your thoughts are not my thoughts.  You have a greater plan and can see the big picture when I can only see part of it.  As I go through disappointments in life, help me to focus on You rather than my pain.  I love You and trust You.  Amen.</string>

				<string>How do I prepare now for the future?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives&apos; tales; rather train yourself to be godly.  For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.&quot;  I Timothy 4:7-8</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The best way to prepare for the future is to be in relationship with the One who knows what the future holds, not just for you but for everyone.  Of course, the One we are talking about is Jesus Christ.  Seek Him.  Spend time in prayer…not just talking to God but also listening as well.  Read the Bible and then put it into practice in your own life.  Life is way too short to focus on things that won&apos;t last so ask the Lord to make you a guy or girl of character.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>This week memorize I Timothy 4:7-8 and ask Christ to show you how to train yourself to be godly.  Spend at least 5 minutes each day reading His Word.  If you don&apos;t know where to start, the book of John is a great place.  See how Christ lived His life and follow after His example.
Pray: Lord Jesus, Help me to follow your example: to follow the Father and to love and serve others well.  Give me a hunger and thirst for your Word.  Help me to focus more on eternal things rather than things that won&apos;t last.  In your name, Amen.</string>

				<string>How can I know God&apos;s will for my life?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I have considered my ways and have turned my steps to your statutes.&quot; Psalm 119:59

&quot;Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.&quot;  Psalm 119:105</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>If you want to know God&apos;s will for your life then you need to be in His Word.  We are told in the Bible that &quot;all Scripture is God-breathed&quot; (II Timothy 3:16).  It gives us guidance, comfort, encouragement, hope and direction.  His basic principles given in the Bible will give you direction for more detailed decisions in your own life: should you date so and so, what college should you go to, how should you spend your time during the summer. Go ahead. Give it a try. I dare you!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Take a week to read through all of Psalm 119.  Write down every verse that talks about God&apos;s Word.  It may use words like statutes, commands, precepts, decrees, etc.  Then go back and reflect on all the different blessings that come from God&apos;s Word. If you have a certain decision in life that you are trying to find God&apos;s answer to, seek out a person who knows Christ well and ask them to point you towards some passage in Scripture that might help you. Then pray and see how God directs your steps.</string>

				<string>Does God care about my future?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Cast all your anxieties on the Lord because He cares for you.&quot;  I Peter 5:7</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Does God care about your future?  Well, Scripture tells us that he knows the number of hairs on your head (Matt. 10:30).   He also tells us that if He cares as wonderfully for the wildflowers that are here today and gone tomorrow that He will certainly care for you (Matt. 6:30).  And not only does He desire to care for us but He also knows all our needs before we even need them (Matt. 6:32).   If He cares deeply for you then He also cares deeply about your future.  Christ&apos;s first desire for your future is that you would know Him personally and that you would live a life with Him.  Do you have a personal relationship with Him?
Find a time soon to go outside and enjoy the world that God created.  Breathe deep.  Look at the clouds in the sky.  Watch the birds fly.   Notice the grass, the trees and the flowers around you.  Meditate on the truth that Jesus loves you enough that He died a horrible death for you.  Thank Him for all the ways that you see Him caring for you now…some examples might be having food to eat, a roof over your head, friends who listen, family who loves you, etc.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Pray:  Jesus, thank you for loving and caring enough about me that you were willing to die on the cross for me.  Thank you that you sent the Holy Spirit so that I can always have you with me.  Thank you for knowing me intimately to where you even know how many hairs are on my head.  Help me to come to you with my hopes and dreams of the future and to seek your direction for my life.  Thank you for caring about all of me, including my future plans.  Amen.</string>

				<string>What does the Bible say about drinking alcohol?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.&quot; Galatians 5:19-23</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible is clear about drinking alcohol or putting dangerous substances, like drugs, into our bodies.  Anything which can damage your body or impair your good judgment is wrong in the sight of God.  God created you and desires for each person to take care of their body and mind.  God knows the impact things like alcohol and drugs make on a persons body and life; they cause disease and harm relationships with those we love.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Remember, the Lord created you and me.  He designed our bodies with incredible capabilities to live the life He has given you.  When we put harmful things into our bodies we get harmful results.  The Lord will fill all of our mind, heart and souls greatest desires if you will let Him.  No void or longing is too great for the Lord.  He is enough.
Read 1 Corinthians, chapter 6 and answer this question posed by Paul, &quot;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?&quot; YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN.</string>

				<string>What is so wrong about getting drunk or drinking to excess?  What&apos;s the big deal?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord&apos;s will is. Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.&quot; Ephesians 5:17, 18 

&quot;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own.&quot; 1 Corinthians 6:19</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>These verses emphasize that the Lord wants us to be full of the Spirit and not full of substances that alter our decisions. We are made by God and our body is not our own when we have Christ.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Remember, The Lord created you and me.  He designed our bodies with incredible capabilities to live the life He has given you.  When we put harmful things into our bodies we get harmful results.  The Lord will fill all of our mind, heart and souls greatest desires if we will let Him.

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I handle the peer pressure that comes by others when I avoid partying?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear; do not be frightened. But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. It is better, if it is God&apos;s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.&quot; 1 Peter 3:13-17</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Simply put, it is better to do good and suffer than to do evil and suffer. Put your hope in Christ and not in people.  God notices your good behavior and you will be blessed.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Always be kind to others and do not judge them, but offer yourself as a living example of how Jesus would want you to act.  Sometimes the only Jesus someone knows is the Jesus they see in you. Shine your light for others to see as you go on the path that is right. Chances are you will be admired among others in your same situation lacking your courage and your ability to walk away will inspire them to walk away also. No matter what your peers think, you will be admired by God.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>I see my parents partying and feel like if they get drunk and engage in wrong doing, why can&apos;t I?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.&quot; 2 Corinthians 5:9-10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Our goal should be to please God no matter where we are, what we see or who we trust because we all will appear before HIS judgment.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>It is really a question of judgment.  Parents are our role models, but they are not perfect, just as no one is perfect.  Ultimately, our greatest role model is Christ because he was the only perfect man and our fate is in HIS hands. He asks us to make it a goal to please HIM. When you use good judgment and stray from temptations that bring harm, like drugs, alcohol, and sex, your final judgment will be better off having resisted the urge to party.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>My life is out of control and temptations to get drunk and do bad things are all about me; where is there help?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don&apos;t fall! No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.&quot; 1 Corinthians 10:12-13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Even people that are not &quot;out of control&quot; feel tempted according to the word of the Lord. And HE will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Where is your help? Jesus is the answer.  There will be difficult situations even when you are doing what is right, but God is faithful and he will give you strength to stand and not fall.  Pray:  Give me strength in my weakness.  Keep me from doing bad things when it seems I cannot help myself. Be my help Jesus. I am entrusting you to care for me. I will increase my faith believing you will lift me from the pits of my despair.  In Jesus&apos; name, AMEN.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How often/when should I pray?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Pray continually&quot; 1 Thessalonians 5:17</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God doesn&apos;t want us to stop doing everything and always be in our room on our knees praying. He wants our life to be a life that is always aware of Him and connected to Him. So prayer should be like breathing, wherever we go, we are aware of Him and in communication with Him.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Who in your life are you closest with? How often do you talk and/or text them? The point is this- You communicate with them regularly.  God is everywhere and knows you (Psalm 139:1-18, Matthew 10:30). Start talking to God regularly; wherever you go, whatever you&apos;re doing. You don&apos;t have to get on your knees, close your eyes, and fold your hands together. You can just talk to him; even in your head without talking out loud. 
Watch a sunset or sunrise and tell Him how beautiful His creation is. Think about what you&apos;re thankful for and thank Him. He&apos;s is always there, you can always talk to Him (and He wants you to).  Anytime and anywhere!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Does God speak to me in prayer? How do I know it&apos;s Him?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;…but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.&quot; Hebrews 1:2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Don&apos;t get hung up by the phrase &quot;last days&quot;, this refers to the time after Jesus&apos; resurrection and ascent to Heaven, which means &quot;last days&quot; is right now, TODAY. So, today God has spoken to us. But how does He speak? By his Son, Jesus! You may have heard the old phrase WWJD, &quot;What Would Jesus Do&quot;, but it is more than that, it&apos;s &quot;What would Jesus do AND THINK&quot;. We should have the same attitude as Jesus. We know God speaks to us when we hear the same words that come from the Bible.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>You may hear a small, still voice tell you, &quot;Ashley, go help that lady with her groceries&quot; or, &quot;Connor, help your little brother with his homework&quot;, and  you find those words in the Bible phrased as &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (Matthew 22:39) and this Bible verse makes the voices true. Be warned, many people may claim to have heard from God. But if it goes AGAINST what the Bible says, then they are a LIAR. God does not contradict Himself.
Pray- Lord, since you want me to love others, show me what I can do for one of my family members or friends. Sit and wait for God to speak. When He does- Go do what He said to do- WWJD!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>If God knows everything, why pray? Can I change God&apos;s mind?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The LORD replied, I have forgiven them, as you asked.&quot; Numbers 14:20</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>In this story God was going to do one thing but doesn&apos;t, why? Because Moses asked him not to!  &quot;The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective&quot; according to James 5:16.  Righteous means right standing with God. And we know that all who have faith in Jesus Christ are righteous (Romans 3:22). So, if you have faith in Christ, your prayer is powerful and effective. So which is it? Is God all-knowing or can I change His mind? The answer is YES to both!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God is bigger than we think or can imagine He is. He can do anything, NOTHING is IMPOSSIBLE! But it is better to understand and have a relationship with God, rather than Him being our everyday Santa Clause (if He did bring us stuff non-stop that would make God our servant, and us His master, which is a ridiculous idea).  Would you rather God give you everything you are asking for today and then never talk to you or give you anything ever again? Or would you rather be in constant contact and relationship with God, where when you pray He says &quot;yes&quot;, other times He says &quot;no&quot;, and sometimes He says &quot;wait&quot;? The second option is much better don&apos;t you think? 
Pray to understand God and the goodness of His commands. Try and put yourself in God&apos;s &quot;shoes&quot;. Then pray for what is on your heart.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Does prayer help?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding&quot; Proverbs 3:5</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>He is God and we are not, but He cares about us. He even delights in us (Psalm 18:19). When we pray it is our way of showing we rely on Him and not ourselves, or anyone or anything of this world. Prayer does many things. One thing it does is bring a peace that goes beyond understanding (Philippians 4:6-7). Prayer is also how we confess our sins, which helps us acknowledge our need for Him.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Many times we don&apos;t pray, because we think we don&apos;t need to; this is a lie. We think we have everything under control, but it&apos;s an illusion. Prayer helps us recognize that we are not in control. God, the loving Father, Creator of all things, is in control. 
If you need peace, then in Jesus&apos; name, pray for peace (Philippians 4:6-7). If you need help trusting God, then have a conversation with God about it and ask Him for help to do what Proverbs 3:5 says.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How Do I Pray?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.&quot; Matthew 6:6-8</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus was frustrated with the hypocrites that stood proud praying for all to hear for their own attention.  Prayer is between you and the Lord.  The reward is your relationship with Him, not the attention of others. Praying in prayer groups aloud and for one another is perfectly fine and powerful in agreement with other believers. Simple words, short and sweet are fine ways to pray too. God knows what you need before you ask him. So pray knowing you are a sinner in need of prayer (Romans 3:23), pray believing you will receive (Matthew 21:22) and pray in Jesus name (John 16:23).  Be honest with God, you&apos;re not going to tell him anything He doesn&apos;t know.  Later in this passage Jesus tells you how to pray…</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>WWJP/What would Jesus pray? &quot;Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.&quot; Amen
Check out how Jesus said to pray in Luke 11:1-13 too. You can even try and say them in your own words because it is all about being REAL.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>I feel alone and afraid, no one can help me.  What do I do?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&quot; Matthew 11:29</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus loves you and wants you to come to him. He is gentle, humble and peace itself.  He gave His life so that all who are hurting might find rest in Him.  Close your eyes and imagine him standing open arms with pierced hands stretched forth longing to embrace you. Go on, what are you waiting for, run to him and find your peace.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Find time this week to read Isaiah 43:1-5, and answer the following questions:
What does God say you belong to?  Who has called you?  How does it make you feel that He has pursued a relationship with you?
What difficulties does the Lord say He will walk through with you in these verses?
Think about a difficult time you have had.  How did God show you He was there with you?
In verse 4, how does God describe you?
Why, in verse 5, does God tell us not to be afraid?

Lord Jesus, Help me to remember that You are always with me.  You are with me in the good times and with me in the bad times too.  Help me to be aware of your presence and help me to be satisfied in You alone.  Amen.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why do bad things happen to good people?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&quot; John 16:33</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus was speaking to the disciples before he was about to leave them to face his death knowing they would be without him.  Jesus was good.  Not only was he good, he was perfect. Still, something really bad happened to him.  It wasn&apos;t just bad, it was horrible. He was the Son of God; yet, he was misjudged, abused, beaten and put to death.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God doesn&apos;t promise life will be easy.  Actually he says &quot;you will have trouble&quot;, but keep the faith, realizing Jesus took the ultimate punishment for you. So when this world tries to beat you down, HE has your back all the way to the end.  Your reward comes as you stand faithful in this world, proclaiming Christ and receiving eternal life in Heaven.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why did Jesus have to die if God can do all things?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Since the children have flesh and blood he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil-and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham&apos;s descendants. For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.&quot; Hebrews 2:14-18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This is one of the most perplexing questions we face as Christians.  Jesus is our brother as a descendant of Abraham as are we.  He took the sting of death in our place as a sacrifice for our sins that started back in the Garden of Eden.  God gave us free will and we failed to do what was right and fell to the temptations of Satan.  So God allowed his flesh and blood SON to pay for our flesh and blood...covering us with his grace.  The blood of Jesus covers us, protects us and completes us!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The ways of God are beyond our comprehension and we try to fit our understanding in terms to which we can relate. Relating to God is virtually impossible, but relating to Jesus comes easier because he was a person.  God can do all things and he decides all things.  And even though the decision God made to allow his son to suffer seems unjustifiable, HE alone is the justifier of our souls for &quot;my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither your ways my ways, &quot; declares the Lord. Pray: God thank you for having mercy on my soul and keeping me from the sting of death.  My soul is saved because you forgave. Jesus your blood was shed for me and that is all I need to know. I love you so!  AMEN</string>

				<string>What is the Holy Spirit?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;If you love me, you will obey what I command. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-the Spirit of Truth.&quot; John 14:15-16

&quot;But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you.&quot; John 14:26

&quot;As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit…&quot;1 John 2:27

&quot;The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man&apos;s spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God…&quot; 1 Corinthians 2:10-12

&quot;So live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.&quot; Galatians 5:16</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Holy Spirit was sent by God when Jesus died and went to heaven. He left the Spirit here for us. His instructions were for us to live by the Spirit. The Holy Spirit searches all, knows all and gives all truth. It is our counselor, teacher, anointing, and peace.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Recognize the power of the Holy Spirit. Together God the Father, Jesus the Son and The Holy Spirit make the Trinity. The God head three in one.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why is having money considered evil or wrong according to God?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>Jesus said to him, &quot;If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;  When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot; When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, &quot;Who then can be saved?&quot; Jesus looked at them and said, &quot;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&quot; Matthew 19:21-26</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The rich man in this story was inquiring about what good thing he could do to have eternal life. Jesus told him there was only One who was good and the man persisted. Jesus replied keep the commandments. The man replied I have kept them. The above passage was Jesus&apos; last response to the rich man.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God wants to prosper us and bless us. Money itself is not the problem, it is the control it has over people.  The man was sad because he liked his money and didn&apos;t want to part with it.  We have strong emotional responses to money. We need money to live, but when we live to possess money, we have our priorities wrong.  Money might seem to save us here on earth by giving us food, shelter, transportation, education, etc, but the only one who can save us is God.  The power money has over us is a temptation that if we are not careful can keep us from the kingdom of heaven.  Give God his portion by tithing and planting seed into his purpose and allow him to guide your finances.</string>

				<string>I am sad, but as a Christian shouldn&apos;t I have joy?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;A righteous man may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all…&quot; Psalm 34:19</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>You can be the walking in righteousness with the Lord and still be sad. The good news is that He has your back. He will deliver or carry your sadness.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Jesus was the perfect man walking in righteousness and yet he wept. He wept over the death of his friend Lazarus. He wept over the city of Jerusalem. He wept in sadness. Just because you have the joy of Christ doesn&apos;t mean you are immune to sadness. Maybe you just need a good dose of Jesus to boost your immunities!</string>

				<string>How can I move past my sorrow?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead. I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&quot; Philippians 3:13-14</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Take one step closer to the goal. Just put one foot in front of the other until you are past the sorrow looking back to a speck that used to be your sorrow, but now is unrecognizable because you have gone the distance with Christ carrying you and cheering you along the way.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Nike ads tell us to &quot;just do it&quot;.  Let go and just do it…release the grief to God before it takes an unhealthy hold on you. Don&apos;t carry this burden to the grave. Christ came to set us free from bondage like grief, depression, sadness. Your feelings and thoughts not bowed to the truth of Christ will become the lies of Satan and will handcuff you to loneliness. Resist in the name of Jesus. He bore your grief on the cross. Gladness and joy are meant to be yours!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What does the Bible say about sadness?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;A happy heart makes the face cheerful but heartache crushes the spirit. The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.&quot; Proverbs 15:13-14</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>In these verses we find a comparison between a merry heart and a sorrowful heart. The condition of a man&apos;s heart is told by his facial appearance. Sadness crushes the spirit and makes the heart ache. The Bible tells us many things about sorrow. Here we learn that sadness invades us physically as well as emotionally.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>We can all relate to a friend asking us &quot;What is wrong?&quot; When we are sad we show it on our face. Our eyes lose their sparkle and our smile disappears. Sometimes our chest will actually hurt from the loss of something or someone dear to us, creating literally a heart ache. Do you know someone who has lost their smile? Maybe it is you. Look to Jesus to give you back your smile and your sparkle. Share His joy with those around you suffering from a crushed spirit.</string>

				<string>What is God doing when I am sad?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.&quot; Romans 12:15

&quot;Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.&quot; Hebrews 7:25

&quot;But he said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&quot; &quot; 2 Corinthians 12:9-10</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>According to these scriptures, God is grieving with us, praying for us and carrying us through the sadness.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Jesus said in John 15:15 that He calls us friend.  We have a friend, in addition to a Father and a Savior. Your sadness is His sadness and like a good friend he will be sad with you, pray for you and be strong for you when you are weak. 

Say aloud: I am a friend of God! Yes, He calls me friend!</string>

				<string>What can I look forward to when I am so sad?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;…and provide for those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.&quot; Isaiah 61:3</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God used the prophet Isaiah to speak words of encouragement from Heaven on high.  Back in Biblical days, people would put on sackcloth and ashes to symbolize their grief and mourning. The Lord says you can look forward to a day very soon when you will be wearing a beautiful crown. You will be full of gladness that saturates your person like oil and dressed in the finest garment of thanksgiving for He will deliver you from these days of sadness.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Sadness comes in many different forms. Perhaps you are grieving the loss of a loved one, a relationship or a missed opportunity. Whatever form it takes it can be overwhelming and sometimes can literally make you hopeless. Practical ways to gain your joy back are to force yourself to be in the presence of the Lord by going to church, reading the word of God, posting uplifting verses in your room or car, speaking to a trusted friend or seeking Christian counseling. (See Hope Topic on App) 

Jesus, deliver me from the pits of despair and wrap your everlasting arms about me taking me to higher ground. I need you more than ever. Please replace my sorrow with joy and my tears with laughter. Only you have the power to take this anguish from me. I believe you are more than able and I am yours to mend back to wholeness. I give you my mind, body and soul. In your precious name, AMEN

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How can I be saved?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&quot; John 3:16-17</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>God loves you and created you to be in relationship with Him. Though sin separates us from God, He did not want to see us perish. God sent His one and only Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross. If you believe this, you are saved. You will experience eternal life with Jesus Christ. Eternal life is not something that you can earn, nor does it require works; Jesus tells us that it requires believing in him.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>No one is perfect, just look around. All of us are in need of Jesus, and God knew that when he sent Jesus to die on the cross. Have you admitted this? If so, have you told people about it? Do it. If you haven&apos;t put your faith in God, ask someone who has about it. 
Lord, I admit that I&apos;m a sinner. I often put my own motives and plans ahead of what you have for me. I trust that you sent Jesus to die on the cross, saving me from my sin. Please forgive me when I sin and help me to be more like you. Amen</string>

				<string>How can I help others be saved?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&quot; Acts 1:8</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus tells his disciples to be witnesses throughout every part of the earth. To be a witness involves having personal knowledge of something. The disciples had spent three years with Jesus before his death on the cross; they were instructed to go and teach others about him. Jesus also tells the disciples that the Holy Spirit will give them power. This is true for you as well – the Holy Spirit will be with you as you go and share the good news of Christ.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Think about what it takes to be a witness. You will need to spend time with God, studying his Word, worshiping, praying, and being still. You will experience first-hand the power and love of Christ. Once you have the personal experience, you can tell others about Christ. Remember, you can&apos;t make someone believe something, but you can tell others about Christ and be an example in your daily life. While this may be a scary thing to do, the Holy Spirit is in you and will not leave you.
Eternal life is a serious matter. Ask God to use you in sharing him with your friends and family.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>I&apos;m saved. Now what?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but  rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.&quot; Romans 6:11-14</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Paul tells us that once we are Christians, we are not to keep sinning as before. With Christ on your side, you have the Holy Spirit&apos;s power to break free of being enslaved to sin. Instead of following sinful temptations and behavior, you are to give your life to doing what&apos;s right. God knows that you will still sin, so he gives you grace, but that doesn&apos;t give you permission to keep sinning. God wants you to live a holy life, set apart for him.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>When you get a new phone, how do you treat it? Are you careful not to drop it? Spill water on it? Or do you treat it like an old toy, shoving it under your bed and forgetting about it? In the same way, once you are a Christian, you have a new life in Christ. You are to devote yourself to what&apos;s right and good. Sinful habits often don&apos;t go away overnight, but with the help of the Holy Spirit and someone to keep you accountable, you can break old habits and the things that keep you from God.
Ask God to help you grow in him, do what&apos;s right and put away the old, sinful self.</string>

				<string>Once I&apos;m saved, can I become unsaved?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.&quot; John 10:27-28</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>If you have placed an authentic faith in God, you are one of his sheep. He knows you and has given you eternal life. You listen to him and follow him. No one can snatch you out of his hand. No one. The power of Christ&apos;s blood is more powerful than any human being.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Out of all the things you own, your relationship with God is one of the only things that can&apos;t be taken away from you.  Think about what makes a relationship healthy. Do things like spending time with someone, talking, listening, laughing, or crying come to mind? Work on your relationship with God in the same way you build relationships with friends and family. Once you put your faith in God, you can&apos;t become unsaved.
Pray for people in your life to help you grow in your faith. Obstacles will come, but nothing can overpower God. Pray for wisdom and for God&apos;s strength to shine through you.</string>

				<string>What is &quot;saved&quot;?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot; Romans 6:23</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>When Adam disobeyed what God told him, sin entered the world, causing the relationship between God and man to be broken. To be &quot;saved&quot; means you have put your faith in God, reconciling the broken relationship with Him. It means to be saved from eternity without God.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Think about your words, your actions, your thoughts. What are things that cause you to need to be saved? Are they things that you could truly overcome by yourself in your own strength, or do you need a Savior, someone to save you from your sin?
Lord, thank you for coming to earth to save me from eternity without you. Please forgive my sins and show me areas of my life that I need to clean up. Help me to step out of the way and allow you to work in my life.</string>

			<dict>
				<key>question</key>
				<string>What if I don&apos;t have any self-control?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;…to obey is better than sacrifice…&quot; 1 Samuel 15:22</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Bible is filled with stories of men who didn&apos;t have a whole lot of self-control: Samson, David, Cain, Noah, even Abraham.  Though these guys are credited to be men of God, they ended up falling short in certain areas of their lives due to their sins for which they could not control.  1 John tells us that when sin is full grown, it leads to death.  The word of God says it is DEATH. Eventually, when not dealt with, sin will kill you. It&apos;s easy to say now that porn or lying or a little stealing won&apos;t hurt.  But eventually it can become a real problem that will lead you down a road you don&apos;t want travel.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Obey God and walk away from sin. Write down all the sins in your life that are caused by a lack of self-control.  The list gets long.  Use some of the applications in the other questions to help you get a heads up on self-control. 
God is the ultimate source of strength and endurance.  He wants you to succeed.  Ask him to help you master your will.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is self-control?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.&quot; 1 Peter 1:13</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The biblical idea of self-control comes from the Greek word &quot;KRATOS&quot; which means &quot;strength.&quot;  The idea is that God strengthens you to control your will.  Take hold over your desires and wants and don&apos;t let them rule over you.  With The Spirit of God in you, no sin can master you and you now have the power in you that raised Christ from the dead.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>No man can fully change or control his will on his own.  If you did not save yourself, you cannot change yourself.  But Christ can.  Take time today to ask God to give you the strength to control your will.  Better yet, ask him to replace your will with His. God loves you and desires for you to live a &quot;self-controlled&quot; life. Ask for help.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What example did Jesus give of self-control?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.  All this I will give you,&quot; he said, &quot;if you will bow down and worship me.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.&apos; Then the devil left him, and the angels came and attended him.  Matthew 4:8-11</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Satan offered Jesus power over kingdoms of the world that were in his control and Jesus resisted him showing supernatural self-control given him by his Father in heaven.  And when he did the angels came to offer him peace and comfort.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Be assured that Satan will tempt you to lose control and gosh knows what else, but stand firm in the knowledge that just like Jesus, you have authority in you through HIM to speak, &quot;away from me Satan, for it is written to serve the Lord only&quot;.  So where is it written?  In the Word…the Bible…it is the sword of the Spirit and it is mighty to protect you from the evil snares of the enemy.  
Pray:  Jesus, give me power to resist the temptations of the enemy who comes to steal, kill and destroy.  You are the author of my life and in your word I will abide.  Thank you for giving me power in YOU to have self-control.  In your precious name, AMEN.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How do you have self-control?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;How can a young man (or woman) keep his (or her) way pure?  By living according to Your word.&quot;  Psalm 119:9</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The Old Testament is filled with author&apos;s writing about how great God&apos;s laws are.  Why?  Because they understand that God&apos;s laws mean the best for them.  It&apos;s not about how many you can or cannot keep.  It&apos;s about trusting in God for your salvation and in His power for your obedience.  His word has power and will help you fight against any temptations or desires you battle with.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Memorize numerous verses that have to do with overcoming temptation and learning self-control.  And when the battle begins, use them to fight against sin. 
Read Psalm 119 for more insight on God&apos;s law and power.  Pray for him to help you.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why is self-control important?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God&apos;s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.&quot;  1 John 3:9</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Here&apos;s the deal.  It is absolutely a part of God&apos;s will that you be separate from the world around you.  The world gives in to all the pleasures it sees.  But if you call Jesus your savior, you should only give in to His desires.  His will becomes your will and you no longer live to please yourself.  In doing this, you become an ambassador for the grace and power of Christ.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Write down all the things you see in the world that are caused by a lack of self-control.  After that, write down all the things that are cured by self-control.  Which world would you want to live in?  Ask God to create a pure heart inside of you that is devoted to His will and not yours.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Is pornography bad?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. It is God&apos;s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,  not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before. For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.&quot; 1 Thessalonians 4:2-8  </string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus said we should avoid sexual immorality, that we should strive for honor and holiness rather than give in to the lusts that make us do some really dumb stuff like take advantage of each other for sexual gain. You are called to something much greater than this, you are called to holiness!  It&apos;s not like telling a friend to just hush, when you walk into these things, you are rejecting God Himself, the one who gives you the Holy Spirit!</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Would you say that when you are looking at porn you are lusting?  Yeah, I would too.  The question posed is one that makes us feel like this isn&apos;t as bad since we aren&apos;t doing it, let&apos;s not compare sins.  It&apos;s kind of like asking you if you would rather drink puss from a runny sore or a glass of warm snot from a sick hog…. yeah, um, no thanks. This is a graphic metaphor, but pornography is graphic and its images have Satanic power to trap us into bondage.  Many people struggle with this addiction and it is a stronghold difficult to break.  Don&apos;t even go there, for Christ came to set you free from such slavery.
Ask Christ to remind you who you are in Him.  Ask him to free you from any bondage or desires with porn.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How far is too far?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.&quot; Romans 13:13-14</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Be the same person in all your relationships and actions as you are when you pursue Christ. In fact, wrap yourself up with Jesus and remove yourself from having to contemplate things that will trap you…. including sexual behavior outside of marriage.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Ok, this is a question that is asking the wrong thing.  You are looking for a line, i.e. &quot;how much can I get away with and still be ok?&quot;  The truth is sexual contact shouldn&apos;t really be a destination in your relationships.  Your hormones are raging out of control sometimes and there is no perceived line that will be observed.  The question is one of the heart….who is at the center of yours?  If indeed it is Christ, then go to Him with your concerns.  Chances are very good that the idea of how far to go will be of little concern once you take it to Him. A faith that has us preferring Christ over all things snuffs ill based ideas out and sets us free. 
Pray to Jesus and ask Him to redirect your focus.  Ask Him to be central with your relationships.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is the big deal about sex?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well. Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares? Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers. May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.&quot; Proverbs 5:15-18</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Well, it is a big deal, in fact its great and encouraged the way God intended.  As you read above, he even mentions enjoying it!  He is talking about the confines of marriage, where it is shared between two people who will never share it with anyone else.  King Solomon, the author of Proverbs, isn&apos;t talking about water, he is talking about intimacy.  It&apos;s a big deal because so many things in our future marriage are linked to what we do in this area. Trust, commitment, comparisons, and safety will all be affected in the long run.  Remember purity breeds intimacy.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>You need to pursue wise counsel.  Who in your life knows Christ well and loves you?  Get some of their time and be completely honest with them about where you have been, what you have considered and the questions you have about sex.  When the topic of sex comes up among your friends or &quot;the friend&quot;, listen from where their opinion comes. There is a good chance it comes out of the desire to engage in it, rather than an opinion that comes from a God view of the subject. 
Pray to Jesus that he would guide and reveal to you the importance of sex in your future and why it might be important to follow God&apos;s plan for it in your life.</string>

				<string>Why did God make sex?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>Awake, north wind, 
       and come, south wind! 
       Blow on my garden, 
       that its fragrance may spread abroad. 
       Let my beloved come into his garden 
       and taste its choice fruits. 
  I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; 
       I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. 
       I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; 
       I have drunk my wine and my milk.    
   Eat, friends, and drink; 
       drink your fill of love.&quot; Song of Solomon 4:16-5:1</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Wife- I am ready, it will be awesome, it is yours and yours only for the taking!
Husband- Uh huh! Woooo Hooo, now that&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about! That was AWESOME!
God- Enjoy (seriously, it is in the Bible and that&apos;s what it means)</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>God is the author of sex, it&apos;s that simple.  It&apos;s how he chose that we would bring new life into this world, yes but let&apos;s not discount something, God intended for us to enjoy it!  If we want to experience it the way he intended and without all the consequences and guilt, we just have to wait until we have found the person with whom we will promise God to honor and love the rest of our lives and then… Woo Hoo! God loves you, and sex is good in its proper place, it&apos;s the world that has twisted and perverted it.  Remember fire is good and useful in a fireplace, but not on the curtains and the roof.  
Ask Jesus and the Holy Spirit to reveal to you the truth about sex.  Ask him to give you eyes to see the lies about sex that are sold to us every day in the world.</string>

				<string>If you are in love is it ok to have sex?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.&quot; Song of Solomon 8:4</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string> This is actually taken from a hot moment before a bride and groom will share themselves with each other.  She is pleading with those that follow the Lord to save themselves for this moment.  This woman is experiencing the moment of giving herself to her groom and wanting that very thing for everyone else.  It is something that will be defended for years and given once.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Let&apos;s be honest, &quot;love&quot;?  You likely feel a great deal for them but if you go and read a little bit about true love in the Bible you will see that it is wrapped up in far more than making out.  The likelihood of the person you are with right now being the one you marry is not good, right up there with each of us knowing we will be a singer selling out all venues and winning a Grammy since we did just sing in the school play last week… could happen, but it isn&apos;t likely.  So you don&apos;t engage in what is a desire for the day. If you love them, honor them by not being tempted or even better, by not tempting them.  If it is true love, time will tell and when you finally take this person as your spouse, you will have a precious gift to give that has not been given before…pure and ONLY for your one true love.   
Pray and ask Jesus to guide your relationship and heart.  Ask him to teach you about true love.</string>

				<string>If something I&apos;m doing is causing stress, should I just not do it?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&quot; Philippians 4:7</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This verse tells us that the peace of God goes beyond reason.  His peace can cover all our worries.  Those we have imagined and made worse in our minds and those that are weighing heavy on our heart.  He can guard our hearts and minds with his perfect peace.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Sometimes you might think you have too much on your plate with school, sports, extra-curricular activities, relationships, parents, friends and more. HOWEVER, that doesn&apos;t mean you can just quit something if it makes life easier. You need to look at all the things in life that you are involved in and ask yourself, &quot;Am I able to do my best at this in order to bring glory to God?&quot; If the answer is no, what else in your life can be shifted around or dropped in order to do your best? When you don&apos;t know what to shift or drop, put your complete reliance on your Savior to give you guidance. When there is something that can be shifted or dropped, talk to your parents, pastor or mentor first before making the decision. You may not be able to see the big picture now, but everything God has placed in your life is in your best interest.
Sometimes we think that everything in life is stressing us out, but it&apos;s because we don&apos;t take time to read the Word and spend time with Him. He will give us peace, unlike anything we can imagine, if we just trust and rely on Him.</string>

				<string>How do I work well through stress?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;An angel from Heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.  And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.&quot; Luke 22:43-44</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The best example we can take is from Jesus.  Just hours before He was crucified for our sins, Jesus was in anguish over what he knew was about to happen to Him.  How did He handle it?  The Bible says he prayed so fervently that his sweat became blood.  That means he broke blood vessels in His head he was praying so hard.  The first thing we should always do when stressed out is turn to God in prayer.  Notice what happened to Jesus when He prayed: He was comforted.  Yes, He was eventually crucified to save the sins of the world, but God helped Him through it, just like he will help you.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>What task is before you that you need to accomplish without the stress? God is around you and his Holy Spirit is in you, if you have accepted Him as your Savior, and is always ready to hear from you.  Any time you are stressed out, and for any reason, you can just ask him to help you through it.  You can say it aloud or just think it.  That&apos;s the great thing about God!  He is always there and He will help you!.</string>

				<string>My parents cause me more stress than anything, what can I do about that?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.&quot; Colossians 3:20</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>The key phrase here is &quot;in everything.&quot;  For many teenagers, this seems impossible.  In fact, parents seem to be the sworn enemy of their lives!  You have to remember, though, that this is simply not true.  The Lord placed your parents in your life for a very specific reason and when you obey them you obey Him, and this pleases the Lord.  God put parents in your life to care for you and look after you.  If you have Christian parents they want to raise you up to look more like Jesus.  Unfortunately, some kids don&apos;t have Christian parents, but by obeying our parents we obey God and please Him. In your obedience you might just show parents lacking Christ, the Christ in you. Obedience equals blessing and blessing is NOT stressing.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The ultimate goal of our lives should be to please God.  While this is very hard sometimes, and we all forget this at times, it is the very best, least stressful way to live.  Jesus said He came to give us life to the fullest.  This doesn&apos;t mean an easy life, but it does mean a life where we can please God and not have to worry because we know He will take care of us.  A small part of that is obedience to our folks.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>How come some people never get stressed out?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?&quot; Matthew 6:26-27</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>You are much more valuable than the birds of the air and you are not adding to your life by worrying.  Many reports say that worrying causes illness and takes away from your life.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Appearances are not always what they seem. You may think that some people don&apos;t get stressed, but they may have just found a way to handle it. Some practical things you can do to avoid stress are:  1. Be realistic: don&apos;t try to be perfect, no one is. 2. Get enough sleep: you might think you don&apos;t need much, but a good night&apos;s sleep keeps you going. 3. Learn to relax:  find something that calms you down (listening to music, writing, dancing, jogging, etc) and make sure to find time for it. 4. Watch your attitude: your attitude can influence the way you respond to people and the way you see things.  Keep it in check.  All these little things can help, but the ultimate refuge is the Lord. 
Take into account the practical things you can do to keep stress low, but rely on the Lord first and foremost. Make sure to tell him what is bothering you and ask for His help in managing your life.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Is being stressed out a sin?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.&quot; Philippians 4:6</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>When you are worried or stressed out, you are not totally and fully releasing your cares to the Lord. Do you believe that He is big enough and wise enough and powerful enough to handle your situation? Even though certain times in life will be busier and more stressful than others, we know that He will never give us more than we can handle. It is completely understandable to have concerns over something, but we cannot let it take hold of us. We must hand those over to the Lord with complete trust that He will handle everything in our best interest.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Sometimes the best thing to do to relieve stress is to talk about it, and who better to talk with than your Heavenly Father who knows every detail about you and your life? Spend some time releasing your cares and concerns to Him when you get worried or stressed.  Jesus is the ultimate stress reliever.  
Find a quiet place to talk with Him about your worries.  He is always available.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What is wrong with being stuck up?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;The greatest among you will be the servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;  Matthew 23:11-12</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus was frustrated by the Rabbi as teachers of the law.  These men were responsible for spiritual guidance by teaching and preaching, but they failed to do what they taught and preached. Instead, they were full of pride and conceit.  In other words they were stuck up.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>The word humble means to be meek, modest or low in station, stature or rank.  Jesus says he is the one who will exalt us if we position ourselves as servants.  I don&apos;t know about you, but I would much rather be placed higher by HIS doing than by my doing.  To be stuck up means I would be standing on the backs of people I trampled to get to that position. When our Lord exalts us, it is being stuck up in the best possible way.  
Jesus, I don&apos;t want to be stuck up even when others around me make me feel low if I&apos;m not. As I release my pride, I thank you for positioning me where you want me and for knowing best. AMEN!</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What do I do when friends act stuck up toward me?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another brotherly love; honor one another above yourselves. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction faithful in prayer.&quot; Romans 12:9-10, 12</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Sincerity is being open and truthful.  In the King James Version of the Bible it says &quot;love without dissimulation&quot;.  Dissimulation means to disguise or mask.  The Lord tells us not to mask our love and to be truthful. From the first question in this topic, &quot;what is wrong with being stuck up&quot;, we know that God wants us to be humble to one another.  Acting prideful or stuck up is the opposite of love; it is evil.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>If someone talks down to you or treats you as if you are not good enough then they are not a friend.  Even if they wear the mask of being stuck up around certain people, but in private time with you take off the mask revealing a better image, it still does not show the brotherly love Jesus wants for you. It is being two faced. We should have one face showing our true identities in Christ. Pray for this person and ask the Lord to change their heart.  If you ask HIM to arrange your friendships you will find he knows all your interests, talents, and hobbies better than you do.  Before you know it, you will be surrounded with Godly friends who will love you just the way you are.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>Why are people stuck up?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>He said to them, &quot;You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God&apos;s sight.&quot; Luke 16:15</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>Jesus was upset with the Pharisee&apos;s love for money. God knows your heart.  There is no hiding what you claim to be valuable. There is no hiding pride in God&apos;s eyes. Unfortunately, people seek worth to make themselves feel more important when God alone is the one we should seek to find purpose and importance.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Stuck up is another term for pride. When we justify our actions in what we think will bring us approval before others, it is an issue of pride. And &quot;pride goeth before a fall&quot; says the Lord. If our intentions are to seek the approval of the world, then we fail to highly value God&apos;s intention for our lives and we are detestable in HIS sight. It is harsh, but pride and conceit deeply upset our Lord.
Jesus, help me be more pleasing in your sight, putting away pride and desiring what you deem valuable.  Amen.</string>

				<key>question</key>
				<string>What are the consequences of being stuck up?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.&quot; Proverbs 16:18

&quot;You rebuke the arrogant, who are cursed and stray from your commandments.&quot; Psalm 119:21

&quot;When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.&quot; Proverbs 11:2</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>As you can read pride or being stuck up is BAD and these are just a taste of many verses in the Bible that deal with being stuck up.  Just a few of the potential outcomes of prideful behavior are: destruction, disgrace and rebuke from the Lord.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>Being stuck up can literally kill us.  Pride doesn&apos;t like to be told what to do and it entices us to make bad decisions that bring pain and punishment. Pride hides the truth, denies any problems and won&apos;t admit weakness or seek help.  Pride defies all goodness and falsely positions a person outside of Christ&apos;s purpose.  He died to set us free, to break us from the obstacles blinding us from his glory.  If you are stuck up, you miss the awe wonder of Jesus because you put yourself above HIM.
Jesus, I seek you and your glory. I put you first. Protect me from the pits of pride. Amen.</string>

				<string>What if I prefer those things that seem &quot;stuck up&quot; like looking good and hanging out with people that have a certain image?</string>
				<key>bible quote</key>
				<string>&quot;You are looking only on the surface of things. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as he.&quot; 2 Corinthians 10:7</string>
				<key>explanation</key>
				<string>This passage written by Paul to the church of Corinth was meant to make the people of the church consider who they belong to, report to and consider as their source.  Paul says Christ belongs to all and we should go beyond the surface.</string>
				<key>examples</key>
				<string>A person only looking at outward appearances is shallow.  It is fine to want to have self-respect and look nice in appearance, but when you set a standard that limits your relationships with other children of God, it is judgmental and conceited.  It is liberating to be free from appearances.  Be authentic, be real, and be kind. Jesus would want you to be like him.  Wouldn&apos;t you prefer to be deep in Christ instead of shallow in yourself?</string>
